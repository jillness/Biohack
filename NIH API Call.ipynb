Recognizing this, NC State University has created a core education facility that serves campus-wide needs for graduate students requiring laboratory-based training in aspects of modern biology. This not only facilitates completion of the students' dissertation research, but also lays the basis for career opportunities in academic, government and industrial research settings. Using this campus educational resource as a framework, NC State University proposes to continue a graduate level training program in molecular biotechnology that will involve students from at least 4 colleges and 10 university departments. Ten trainee slots are requested for the next training period, which will be augmented by 4 slots funded from university resources. The program requirements include completing: (1) a graduate level, laboratory minor in molecular biotechnology; (2) an off-campus industrial internship; (3) a capstone biotechnology design course; (4) a course in professional development; (5) a course in research ethics; (6) an annual research symposium; and, (7) a biotechnology-related service project. These requirements are in addition to those associated with the student's particular department or program for the doctoral degree. This program will also provide a central focus for faculty of the various disciplines involved in this training effort to seek out new opportunities for formal and informal research collaboration.     RELEVANCE: Advanced training in molecular biotechnology is critical to modern medical science research and should be a key component of pre-doctoral education for students aspiring to academic, industrial, and government research setting.          \",\n",

As human culture has progressed, we have utilized plants in increasingly sophisticated ways, progressing from breeding- based agriculture through discovery of modern medicines and most recently using biotechnology. We now look to plants to address global issues such as the sustainable production of fuels to mitigate the environmental impacts of fossil fuels. Plant diversity is enormous and relatively litte of the chemical repertoire of plants has been recognized and utilized. Plant biotechnology has the potential to meet many of the current challenges threatening human wellbeing, but maintaining or improving the health of a growing world population against a backdrop of a changing environment will require that plant scientists receive innovative and cross-disciplinary training. The goal of the Plant Biotechnology for Health and Sustainability (PBHS) predoctoral training program is to foster the education, training, and professional development of the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists who will assume leadership positions in health and sustainability-related biotechnology careers, including academia, industry, government, and entrepreneurship. A set of core competencies will be emphasized including integrating a broad set of content areas related to health and reduced environmental impacts, developing critical thinking, and honing communication skills essential for effective collaboration across disciplines.Trainees will be exposed to the full biotechnology pipeline from basic research to commercialization. Emphasis will be placed on building specific skill sets designed to promote personal and professional development and provide a basis for evaluation of trainee performance.  Bachelor's and master's degree level trainees will enter the PBHS program at the end of the second semester of predoctoral training. During the second year of predoctoral work, trainees will take three courses that introduce concepts in plant biotechnology, collaborative and quantitative research and that describe paths for translation of basic research into commercial products. The program will provide stipends to three to seven students at a time for two years each; these NRSA-funded students will be joined by one to two Michigan State University Graduate School-funded students.      \",\n",

      "            \"abstract\": \"This Small Business Innovation Research project will explore the development of mycofiltration &ndash; the use of fungal mycelium as a biologically active filter for removing pathogens from stormwater. As pollution from pathogens is the leading cause of critically impaired waters nationwide, with stormwater strongly linked to this contamination, this cutting-edge research is a timely response to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s focus on safe and sustainable water resources. Although there is substantial evidence that many fungi consume bacteria and secrete antibacterial metabolites, mycological research has remained largely isolated to ecological and pharmaceutical explorations. The proposed mycofiltration research will expand knowledge of the application of fungal biotechnology in an innovative and interdisciplinary way by tying together the fields of public health, environmental engineering and mycology. The research will seek to identify which fungal species and cultivation methods can filter pathogens from stormwater while meeting the physical and temporal demands required for commercialization. These objectives will be accomplished through a university-industry collaboration that will use E. coli removal as a model for pathogen filtration to evaluate the efficacy of mycofilters that meet industry&shy;-mandated permeability and resiliency requirements for stormwater treatment. This research is anticipated to confirm that fungal mycelium can remove E. coli from flowing water, and that mycofilters can be developed to meet design requirements to treat municipal stormwater runoff. &nbsp; The development of mycofiltration technology will have wide-ranging water treatment implications, strong commercial applications and broad benefits to society. Successful laboratory proof-of-concept data (Phase I) will confirm the hypothesis that fungal mycelium can be used as a living water filter &ndash; an approach that has a wide range of water treatment implications, including treatment of a broad array of contaminants. Advanced development and field efficacy data (Phase II) will support the commercial development of mycofiltration as a low-cost, low-impact, and low-footprint technology for removing pathogens from stormwater. The potential value of this applied research effort is a stormwater treatment system that enhances the ability of municipalities to improve stormwater quality while supporting an innovative small business. This technology will broadly benefit society by providing cleaner water for recreation and commercial fishing. Additionally, the research will be disseminated broadly through the principal investigator&#39;s&nbsp;established world-wide speaking engagements, thereby generating interest, engagement and understanding of the place of mycology and innovation in solving the complex problem of non-point water pollution.\",\n",

The project at Bowie State University (BSU) seeks to use the platform of the existing collaboration between Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, BSU and Godfrey Okoye University (GOU) on DNA barcoding projects to infuse basic and advanced interdisciplinary biotechnology concepts and laboratory skills into its biology undergraduate degree program and to train students that are equipped to function as independent laboratory technicians and/or pursue postgraduate degrees in biotechnology/STEM. The Bowie State Applied Biotechnology Initiative (BSABI) builds on a previous NSF project  that supported a genomics lab and a Biotechnology Summer Institute in the Natural Sciences Department.<br/><br/>The BSABI has three key objectives: a) Curriculum enhancement of the Molecular Biology (Biol 303) course, by infusing it with intensive research for discovery-based learning; b) Research infrastructure upgrade to support the curriculum redesign for hands-on research experience for students; and c) International research experience, to provide students opportunity to collect and categorize germplasm in their native environments. The project augments faculty capacity to instruct students through the provision of cutting edge equipment for research and teaching, and by infusing hands-on laboratory activities and undergraduate research projects into an existing molecular biology course.  The DNA barcoding project enables BSU to respond to the growing demands for understanding and categorizing biodiversity. In perspective, besides training 160 minority students to join the STEM workforce, the broader impact of this project is to promote global exploration, biodiversity conservation and utilization of indigenous genetic resources.<br/><br/>The collaboration among Bowie State University (BSU), the DNA Learning Center at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL), NY, and (GOU), Nigeria, fosters a diversity of research experiences, both locally and internationally, for undergraduates in the Department of Natural Sciences at BSU. BSU uses the platform of this existing liaison on DNA barcoding projects among the three institutions to infuse basic and advanced interdisciplinary concepts and laboratory skills into its biology degree program. The ultimate goal is to create student driven class projects that answer pertinent biological questions while providing students with the opportunity to acquire basic but vital laboratory skills for concentration in biotechnology. The hands-on research experience built into the courses operates on an open-lab concept that is designed to promote peer-mentoring and provide students with independence to explore and be creative in their discovery-based learning experience.<br/><br/>Over the course of the three-year project, at least one hundred and sixty (160) underrepresented minority undergraduates will receive state of the art education and advanced training in molecular biology and biotechnology.  An extensive evaluation process is incorporated into the project to monitor and measure program effectiveness.

      "            \"abstract\": \"NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: <br/><br/>The research is expected to overcome a number of challenges encountered by researchers synthesizing metal alloy nanostructures.  Using a core/alloy approach, nanoparticles in the size range of 5 to 50 nm will be synthesized with stainless interfaces that are made up of iron, chromium, nickel, aluminum and titanium compositions. These nanomaterial alloys are expected to have unique phase behavior, oxidation properties, and void/defect morphologies.  The ultimate goals of this project are to; develop new 'wet-chemical' synthesis strategies to prepare the nanomaterials, to understand the resulting oxidation and phase behavior, and to control that behavior in order to construct novel structures that have utility in energy and biotechnology sectors. A postdoctoral fellow and multiple graduate and undergraduate chemistry students will be supported. The fellow will gain valuable professional development, and along with the students, will gain valuable experience and training in cutting edge nanomaterial science, materials chemistry and associated instrumental techniques.  The PI will promote minority student involvement in the project, and continue his work in guiding women to professional STEM careers. The work will have a profound affect on the materials chemistry and nanoscience communities in the upstate Syracuse New York region through outreach events, enhancements to undergraduate and graduate course work and via hosting a regional workshop on nanoscience that brings together researchers with similar interests from the region. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY: <br/><br/>This project explores the hypothesis that alloy composition, phase behavior, and oxidation characteristics can be use to control the internal microstructure of nanomaterials. Over the years researchers have mastered the synthesis required for size and shape control of many nanostructures, and today focus is shifting towards being able to process the internal structure of these materials with great precision.  To accomplish this goal, we will prepare new nano-alloy interfaces with stainless steel like compositions that will be used as a chemical tool to control interfacial oxidation rates, which in turn will alter Kirkendall diffusion of defects and vacancies. This will allow for the preparation of nanoparticles with morphologically defined void spaces, including asymmetric ones, which can be controlled with 1-5 nm fidelity.  The goals of this project are to fabricate new non-noble metal nano alloys, to use alloy composition, phase behavior, and oxidation properties to manipulate the internal void structure, and to combine these technologies to tailor internal void symmetry and hierarchy.  Moreover, through the course of the project, a number of novel nano-alloy interfaces will be attempted, including titanium and aluminum based medical  and super-alloys. These new nanomaterials will have immediate applications ranging from the energy to biotechnology sectors, including; gas storage, heterogeneous catalysis and battery technologies, as well as medical alloy surfaces and coatings.\",\n",

Partnerships with Industry Alliance Committee members are increasing student internship offerings and utilizing industry feedback to align key courses with industry needs and therefore establishing a feedback mechanism that continually improves student outcomes. Increasing internship participation rates for all students and aligning key courses with industry needs contributes highly trained entry-level employees into the local technology economy. The PACE program addresses students in need of remediation and improves the retention of all students by using Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) activities in selected courses. POGIL activities engage students in higher levels of thinking and collaborative group learning. It is a proven pedagogy that promotes many skills employers seek: teamwork, communication, problem solving, strong work ethic, analytical approach, taking initiative, critical thinking and time management. By implementing POGIL, technology students are more active in their learning and are better equipped with useful skills to enter the workforce. The PACE Science Program allows CCM to meet the needs of the STEM economy and the alliance with local industries demonstrates the success of the project by the number of prepared technicians produced and successfully employed.\",\n",

Such policies have historically had to contend on the one hand with anxieties about declining crop yields and population growth, and on the other hand with concerns about a reliance on plant biotechnology and rainfed grains impacts ecology and biodiversity. The research will be situated in the Himalayan foothills and on millet production. This is an ideal area for investigating such issues, given the enormous size of the population served by this agricultural sector, the government's 20-year engagement with economic liberalization practices, and the recent implementation of a national food security strategy designed to address the problems of expanding population growth and stifled grain yields through the intensification of high yield millet production. The researcher will analyze the symbolic, cultural, and political economic dimensions of competing projects for food security/sovereignty, biodiversity, and development and how they impact and utilize local knowledge systems. Her findings will contribute an ethnographic, case-based understanding to regional, national, and transnational debates about food, agriculture, and rural livelihoods.<br/><br/>The project will involve ethnographic fieldwork across local, national, and transnational settings.  To gather data on the agroecological labor and livelihoods of farmers, the researcher will spend 9 months in two villages of differing altitude in Uttarakhand, north India where she will use participatory methods and conduct participant observation and interviews. To understand how rainfed grains and farmers are implicated in concerns about food security/sovereignty, biodiversity, and plant biotechnology, the researcher will conduct interviews, archival research, and participant observation for 4 months at key research, governing, corporate, and NGO sites in India and Switzerland. She will also analyze news articles, publications, and media sources, and attend conferences and events concerning food, agriculture, hill ecologies, and women in development. <br/><br/>This research will contribute to growing anthropological debates about food security, sustainability in agriculture, and the anthropology of development. In particular, the project will help scientists better understand the social and ecological implications of plant biotechnology, food governance practices, and biodiversity.<br/><br/>This project will contribute to training a graduate student in multi-sited ethnographic methods. The research will expand knowledge of global food systems; conflicts over the right to food, nature, and property; and the process of economic development.\",\n",

Research will pursue energy-positive nutrient recovery from wastewater with microalgae, and will focus on overcoming critical knowledge gaps that limit our ability to design mixed community microalgal bioprocesses that might bring this transformation within reach. Objectives of the research are (i) to elucidate the mechanisms governing microalgal bioprocess performance across a landscape of possible designs, and (ii) to establish a path forward for energy positive nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) recovery from wastewater. Experiments with mixed communities of microalgae treating wastewater will be coupled with modeling to advance understanding of how key design parameters influence process performance, microbial community structure and function. These findings will be integrated in a QSD framework (including life cycle assessment, life cycle costing, sensitivity and uncertainty analyses) to identify technology targets and chart a path forward for microalgal wastewater biotechnology development.<br/><br/>Research efforts will be integrated with an education plan designed (i) to increase the intrinsic motivation of minority and female students in introductory- and advanced-level environmental engineering courses through an aspirational resource management framework, and (ii) to increase awareness of and ability to navigate trade-offs among environmental, economic, and performance sustainability criteria for engineered systems. These goals will be achieved by developing two online course modules that will be designed, tested, and deployed at UIUC, Bucknell University, and Parkland College. Modules will be designed through cognitive labs and will include external, independent formative and summative evaluations.<br/><br/>Current approaches to nutrient management at wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) use costly, energy-intensive processes that rely on bacteria and chemicals to remove nitrogen and phosphorus. This research will re-envision nutrient management at WWTPs by utilizing native microalgae for energy-positive biological nutrient recovery. In addition to increasing the embodied chemical energy of wastewater more than 2-fold, this approach may also advance the limit of technology by overcoming the critical barrier of dissolved organic nitrogen, a form of N that is often unable to be removed by existing nutrient removal processes but which can be rapidly assimilated by microalgae. The core concept of the research plan is microalgal technology development can be expedited through integration of experimentation, modeling, and QSD. This integrated process will elucidate molecular-scale barriers to systems-scale sustainability and seek to overcome them through process design. This approach will enable the setting of targets for technology performance, and identify critical areas for future research to achieve long-term adoption and sustainability. The research activities will be coupled with educational activities to increase the attraction and retention of underrepresented students by focusing on aspirational outcomes of environmental engineering and developing a new platform for education in sustainable design.\",\n",

Recent data indicate that fewer qualified graduates will be available yearly for professional positions, particularly in agricultural biotechnology. This is due partly to the low number of students choosing STEM fields, enrolling and remaining in baccalaureate programs. This project aims to enroll and graduate at least 15 students in agricultural biotechnology at FVSU through systematic and proven outreach to local high schools focusing on underrepresented students. This project&#39;s four objectives support critical NIFA program need areas of recruitment, retention and outreach to K-12 to positively impact college preparation and career awareness: 1) Strengthen STEM competencies, develop career awareness/interests of high school students and teachers in agricultural biotechnology, 2) Offer biotech workshops to high school teachers and students entering agricultural biotechnology career tracks, 3) Provide Biotech Summer Academy for High School Students interested in CAFST majors, and 4) Strengthen the Comprehensive Academic Support Program by incorporating specific transition and retention enrichment activities. Enrolled students will be engaged in academic enrichment activities coupled with a summer internship to enhance their career preparation. A logic model comprehensively describes the project&#39;s inputs, outputs, and outcomes form the basis for project evaluation. The project will advance the institutions &amp; NIFA&#39;s missions to recruit, retain and graduate higher numbers of professionals in plant biotechnology.

The development of genetically-modified (GM) products and their subsequent introduction into the food system about a decade ago, represents one of the most significant innovations in the agri-food system. It has also been a highly controversial one. While agricultural producers have responded to the agronomic benefits associated with the producer-oriented, first generation of GM products and have been adopting GM crops in increasing numbers, consumers around the world have expressed an aversion to food products containing GM ingredients. Consumer opposition to GM products varies significantly both between and within countries and is founded on health, environmental, ethical and/or philosophical concerns about agricultural biotechnology. Similarly diverse have been the countriesAE regulatory responses to GMproducts with the issue of labeling being a focal point in policy forums around the world. For instance, while the US opposes the labeling of GM products arguing the osubstantial equivalenceo between the current, producer-oriented GM products and their conventional counterparts, the European Union has introduced mandatory labeling of GM products on the basis of its oprecautionary principleo and the expressed consumer aversion to these products. In addition to shaping the regulation of products of biotechnology, the vocal consumer opposition to the first-generation GM products has hurt the prospects of agricultural biotechnology and resulted in efforts by life science companies to develop consumer-oriented, second-generation GM products with augmented functional properties. While many of these consumer-oriented GM products are close to their commercialization stage, the economic ramifications of this shift in the focus of agricultural biotechnology and the subsequent introduction ofconsumer-oriented GM products into the food system have not been examined previously. The goal of this project is to systematically analyze the market and welfare impacts of the introduction of new GM products into the agri-food marketing system, examine the economic ramifications of different regulatory and labeling standards, and determine the impact of cooperatives on product and process innovation activity. The proposed research is of particular importance for the US where: (i) 89% of last yearAEs soybean crop and 61% of last yearAEs corn plantings were of biotech varieties that are resistant to a popular herbicide or insect pests (the relevant figures for the state of Nebraska were 90% and 76% for soybeans and corn, respectively), (ii) innovation activity attracts significant resources, equivalent to 10.14% of Agricultural GDP in 1998, and (iii) cooperatives account for 25% to 30% of total farm supply and marketing expenditures. At the same time, US agriculture in general, and theagricultural sector of Nebraska in particular, are affected significantly by agri-food policies both at home and abroad.\",\n",

These phages, due to their ability to infect one cell and then infect another cell, play an important role in moving genes from one bacterium to another and in maintaining population numbers of bacteria. Study of bacteriophages provides insights to genome evolution, bacterial adaptation to new conditions, how DNA is expressed and copied, and potentially provides new biotechnology products. Phage products can be used in food safety for diagnostics and therapeutics, in plant and animal gene transfer methods, and in developing anti-bacterial reagents against infectious bacteria, to name a few. Because of the vast number of bacteriophages extant, and the even larger number of unexplored genes that they carry, additional research is needed to fully understand and benefit from the biology and biotechnology of phages. The methods and approaches used, that of DNA sequencing, bioinformatics analysis, and gene function study, are procedures used in contemporary genomics research and to train the next generation of scientists, educators and industry employees. Some of the bacteria targeted for study with bacteriophage genomics include Mycobacterium (useful for environmental bioremediation), Aeromonas (a fish pathogen impacting aquaculture), Xanthomonas (a pathogen of fruit trees), and Salmonella (a pathogen found in poultry products). Phages infect all of these organisms of agricultural importance and study of their biology and biotechnologically useful gene products have the potential to improve food safety and agricultural yields.\",\n",

Identify natural antimicrobial products of food grade microbes to protect foods against spoilage and hazardous microorganisms. 1b. Identify antimicrobial products of food grade bacteria useful in functional food applications to reduce the risk of dental caries (caused by streptococci) and bacterial skin infections (caused by propionibacteria). 1c. Identify and develop food-grade microbes for the production of bioactive components of natural proteins of animal and plant origin to reduce the risk of chronic health problems (obesity/cancer) and to enhance immune responses to infections. 1d. Modify and adapt available gene technologies and production parameters to maximize output of bioactive peptides and proteins. Develop microbial technologies to produce or co-produce unique bioactive peptides and proteins to improve food functionality and for use in functional foods. 2a. Develop microbial technologies for the production and co-production of compatible bioprotective (pathogen control), antitumor (cancer cell control) and health promoting (oral hygiene, stomach ulcers, skin infections) gene products in food fermentation and probiotic microbes. 2b. Develop microbial technologies for the transfer of capacity for functional food ingredient production to other bacteria used as essential starter cultures by dairy food industries. 2c. Develop, modify and adapt strategies to assure culture survival and retain efficacy of bioactive ingredients in functional foods and non-food products (oral hygiene, and skin health). Develop plant cell wall oligosaccharide-based prebiotics from agricultural processing residues rich in pectins and hemicelluloses and test the hypothesis that prebiotics can selectively promote the growth of gut bacteria associated with lean tissue growth to potentially control obesity. 3a. Conduct in vivo analysis of candidate prebiotics. 3b. Discover new pectic and hemicellulosic prebiotics. 3c. Determine if prebiotics can alter the colonic microflora to potentially control obesity. Screen plant cell wall oligosaccharides for biological activity (anti-adhesion of pathogenic bacteria, immunomodulation, induction of apoptosis).Approach:   Lactic fermentation and probiotic cultures will be screened for the production of bioactive peptide and protein products that improve the nutritional quality and functionality of foods and also protect foods by controlling the growth of contaminating bacteria. Natural peptide products also will be tested for effects on abnormal cell proliferation and induction of immune response in selected animal cell cultures to explore possible applications in the improvement of human health. Microbial biotechnology, enzyme, genetic and proteomic technologies will be designed or adapted for developing lactic fermentation and probiotic cultures (streptococci, lactococci and lactobacilli) as microbial cell factories for the larger-scale production of potentially useful bioactive peptide and protein gene products. The effects of prebiotic formulations on the growth and productivity of lactic fermentation and probiotic bacteria in milk environments will be evaluated in prototype food systems. In addition, culture performance in whey effluents of cheese manufacturing will be assessed and improved.\",\n",

As a discipline, marine biotechnology has seen considerable advancement in recent years with an increasing number of valuable products being derived from or inspired by marine life forms.  Hence, this TP has the goal of training a diverse workforce with the appropriate multidisciplinary education to work at the confluence of marine science, organic chemistry, biochemistry, pharmacology, genomics, cell biology, and computational science. In this immediately past cycle of 4 years, we demonstrated that the program could operate as envisioned by both the TP leadership and the NIH with a superb group of highly talented and enthusiastic trainees, one---third of whom are members of underrepresented minority groups.  These trainees are  participating in a robust curriculum in Marine Biotechnology, involved in a student---run invited seminar  speaker program and year---end research retreat, have completed their Responsible Conduct in Research  training on time, and have engaged in the unique Industrial Internship feature of the program during  their period of NIH trainee support.  In this renewal application, four senior faculty no longer involved in  graduate student training have retired from the TP, and five new and diverse faculty in sciences related  to marine biotechnology have been added.  This Training Program has developed considerable campus recognition, and is highly appreciated and supported by campus administration, including generous matching funds as detailed in this proposal and support letters.  The proposed path forward for this TP in the next cycle involves additional solidification of the policies and procedures of this training program, further enhancement of our underrepresented minority and people with disabilities recruitment, and refinement of the running of the program with greater use of our External Advisory Committee and other participant feedback.      \",\n",

UMA has a history of strength in biotechnology, founding the Institute for Cellular Engineering (ICE) as a platform to sustain and develop novel research and training programs. Given the successful track record of ICE training programs, geographic proximity to a leading biotech hub in Boston, and strong institutional support for development of industry-academic collaborations, UMA is ideally positioned to develop an impactful Biotechnology Training Program (BTP). BTP objectives are to: 1) create a scholarly and social infrastructure to facilitate new and strengthenexisting interdisciplinary networks at UMA, particularly those at the interface of engineering and the life sciences; 2) educate students in the fundamentals of quantitative biotechnology through new lecture and laboratory courses; 3) train students to appreciate the impact of biotechnology commercially through a tailored industrial internship and regular interactions with industrial personnel; 4) provide students with opportunities to improve interdisciplinary communication, expand career opportunities, and sharpen professional skills; and 5) increase the number of students, particularly those from URM groups, who pursue careers in biotechnology.  This BTP will recruit matriculated predoctoral students from five programs (Chemical Engineering, Chemistry, Polymer Science & Engineering, Veterinary & Animal Sciences, Molecular and Cellular Biology). We request six Trainee slots (matched with two slots from UMA). Traineeships will be awarded to students in their 2nd and 3rd years of study, and we will offer an Associate membership for non-funded students to broaden the impact of the program. Students will complete a prescribed curriculum over two years and obtain a graduate certificate in Cellular Engineering. Innovative features include the Biotechnology Core Course that is informed by and co-taught by industry personnel; specialized Laboratory Modules in biotechnology-relevant approaches and techniques modeled after professional industry workshops; student-run Biotechnology Journal Club to break down discipline barriers in a non-threatening atmosphere; a newly designed course in Biostatistics and Statistical Computing to promote math fluency for all Trainees; collaboration with the STEM Diversity Institute to ensure a diverse student population; an annual Symposium on Biotechnology that offers a unique 'Speed Dating' experience where students pitch their ideas and receive feedback from industry experts; and targeted partnering with the new UMA Graduate School Office of Professional Development to provide career exploration and planning for our students. We have recruited numerous industrial partners to support a hallmark of our program, a formal internship in which all Trainees will participate.      \",\n",

The program provides 2 years of funding to meritorious students, with the contractual understanding that students will participate in all program activities for their entire graduate careers. The trainingexperience involves a unifying and multifaceted curriculum which includes: 1) specialized courses that provide the student with critical perspectives of the field from three different vantage points (academic research, industrial R&D, and new ventures); 2) summer industrial internships; 3) training in the responsible conduct of research; 4) an Annual Symposium; and 5) a Ph.D. dissertation research project in one of the laboratories of our 39 participating faculty mentors who are appointed in many different life science and engineering departments. We are requesting 10 NIH-funded predoctoral positions per year for 5 years. Rutgers has committed significant matching fellowship support, stipend and tuition supplements, and other administrative support. Industrial interaction is exceedingly strong, with industrial investigatorsparticipating in the teaching of courses, presenting at the Annual Symposium, hosting summer interns, providing matching support, serving on thesis committees, and occasionally hosting students for a part of their Ph.D. dissertation work. The participating graduate programs and departments, together with several biotechnology related centers provide exceptional facilities for comprehensive biomedical biotechnology research and education. Vigorous and extensive recruitment efforts are expended to attract applicants to the program, and only students of exceptional abilities and motivation are admitted. The program also vigorously recruits students from under-represented minorities into the biotechnology field with excellent success. Student progress is continuously monitored through progress reports (and via individual development plans in the future). These documents, as well as surveys of the students' progress in their careers after they leave the university will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the program. These efforts will continue unabated through the ongoing program, which will continue to produce professionals who are well-educated within a single discipline and have the cross-disciplinary skills needed to conduct independent research and development at the forefront of the constantly evolving discipline of biotechnology.      \",\n",

This training will focus on translating academic research into relevant medical technology and products and will expose students to a variety of biomedical career opportunities beyond academic research. The goals of the BLP are to train the next generation of biotechnology leaders by i) introducing students to different caree options, ii) introducing students specifically to industry-focused biomedical research, and iii) informing students about important nonscientific concerns that govern the translation of academic research projects into commercial products, including financial, regulatory, ethical, and legal issues that can accompany product or technology development and implementation. With 21 outstanding faculty from three Caltech Divisions, Caltech's interdisciplinary BLP will focus on micro- and nano-medicine due to Caltech's strength in this area, its importance for the future of health, and the huge opportunities for technology development. The BLP will support trainees for interdisciplinary research developing molecular sensors and controllers, (low cost) microscale/nanoscale medical diagnostics, and microscale/nanoscale therapeutic materials and prosthetics. Many of the training faculty and their students have developed products for human health and successfully translated their research to industry; this BLP will build upon this exceptional Caltech track record to train the next generation. The BLP will draw trainees from PhD programs in bioengineering, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, computer science, electrical engineering, neurobiology, and medical engineering. Trainees will be required to take specific courses in mathematics, biochemistry or physiology, entrepreneurship, and responsible conduct of research. They will intern in industry during their training, and will participate in program activities that include visits to innovative companies, seminars from industrial leaders, and training in entrepreneurship. Collaborations with industry and among different research groups will be encouraged. The BLP will support 8 trainees per year (six with NIH funds, two from Caltech funds); students on other support (e.g. outside fellowships) will also participate in the program. We expect the BLP to provide new opportunities to recruit and train exceptional under-represented minority, disadvantaged and disabled students for leadership roles in micro/nanomedicine.      \",\n",

This goal is achieved through a cohesive 2-year training program entailing multidisciplinary research, a common curriculum composed of formal coursework in life science and engineering and of a cross-disciplinary laboratory rotation, and an industrial internship. The required coursework is comprised of a course in macromolecular synthesis and structure, a course on molecular biotechnology from an engineer's perspective, the 'Biotechnology Forum' course, and a class in research ethics. Life science trainees must work in the research laboratory of an engineering mentor for at least three months; likewise the engineers spend time in the laboratory of their life science mentor. A biotechnology community is fostered principally through the monthly trainee lunch seminar series and the Annual Biotechnology Symposium, which brings together ~50 students, faculty and industry representatives. Trainees who complete this program will be equipped to function productively in the multidisciplinary teams of bioengineers and life scientists prevalent in the industry. The interface between the life/health sciences and engineering is extraordinarily rich in its diversity and this biotechnology program focuses broadly on molecular and cellular research. Faculty participants in the proposed BTBSE Program all mentor Ph.D. students who conduct research focused at the molecular and cellular level, and most have established cross-disciplinary collaborations. Three interconnected theme areas have been identified and are i) synthetic biology and metabolic engineering; ii) bionanotechnology and tissue engineering; and iii) Molecular, Cellular and Systems Biology. Such an array of research activities conducted by collaborating researchers provides an exciting menu of multidisciplinary research opportunities to trainees. Faculty participants in the proposed training program have had the opportunity to recruit from a pool of over 100 eligible Ph.D. students this academic year. The Director and faculty mentors are very active and successful in underrepresented minority student development and recruitment, especially from the very diverse, populous greater Los Angeles area. Several major changes are noted for this renewal application, including change of the program director to Prof. Yi Tang, turnover of ~20% of training faculty to increase collaboration and training participation, and reconstitution of the training committee members.      \",\n",

BTP trainees are recruited from Chemical & Biological Engineering, Chemistry, Integrated Program in Biochemistry, Microbiology Doctoral Training Program and 15 other excellent doctoral programs, allowing access to ~1300 prospective training-grant eligible applicants each year. Members of the Steering Committee and established BTP trainers serve on PhD program admissions committees and forward their very best applicants to the BTP Steering committee, which further reviews this highly select group for academic excellence, stated interest in interdisciplinary training, previous career activities, future aspirations, and program balance, and then offers BTP support to a subset of these diverse and highly qualified nominees.  During the first year of our program, all BTP trainees participate as a cohort in (1) the BTP-originated Foundations of Biotechnology course and (2) complete the BTP-led Responsible Conduct of Research course. Also starting in the first year, and continuing throughout their three-year training period, all BT trainees participate in (3) the BTP-led Biotechnology Seminar as both presenters and participants, the (4) Winter Banquet, and the biannual (5) Evening Forum. At the end of the first semester of graduate studies, BTP trainees pick a thesis advisor, who must be an approved BTP trainer. During the remainder of the first and second years, every BTP trainee is required to (6) produce an individual training plan with their PhD mentor, (7) identify a BTP minor Professor from another discipline to serve on his or her dissertation committee and monitor their progress in the BTP, (8) develop and complete a BTP-approved biotechnology-oriented minor degree plan, and (9) defend his or her thesis research in a preliminary exam during the spring or summer of their second year. During the third year of support, corresponding to the preference of our industrial partners for interns with advanced skills, BTP trainees undertake (10) an internship and take another BTP-approved Responsible Conduct of Research course to complete their training. In this revised proposal, we describe the establishment of a formal relationship with University Research Park to provide additional opportunities for our trainees to complete their required internship.  The training experiences described above ensure that all BTP trainees have an enhanced educational experience and ample opportunities beyond those provided by their PhD degree programs to become conversant in the principles of chemistry, biology, engineering and quantitative sciences, to take a breadth of courses to support this, and to develop additional professional speaking, writing and planning skills required to become leading cross-disciplinary scientists and engineers in the biotechnology field.   \",\n",

BTP students in training (15) or graduated (47) entered with an average undergraduate GPA of 3.70, currently include 2 minorities and 1 financially disadvantaged, and are hosted by 6 different departments. Over the course of the existence of the UVA BTP, trainees and graduates (19%    minority or disadvantaged) have received multiple awards, experienced 51 different externships from 38 different companies, and after graduation are now employed in industry (22), academia (14; including 4 Ass't and 1 Assoc Professors), government (3), medicine (5), or foundation (1). One is a company president, two are Directors at GSK and Amgen, and another is an NSF Deputy Director. Since '05, 75 first author articles have been published in journals with impact factors as high as 24. Trainees have taken direct responsibility for programmatic features of the BTP including: BTP Symposia and Seminars, BTP Day of Caring, BTP Industrial Q&A Panels and BTP company tours. Mentoring our trainees is a highly engaged, collaborative and well-funded faculty of 42 individuals from 15 departments. Institutional support has been essential for our success, including Vice President for Research in help with externship and Symposia funding, and an additional training slot funded by the School of Engineering. We view the BTP's mission as threefold: (i) most importantly to train our students to be exceptional scientists who will ultimately contribute to society in diverse professional positions in biotechnology, (ii) to provide a meaningful experience in industrial science via our externship program, and (iii) to promote scientific synergy among BTP students of different disciplines through regular BTP Journal Clubs/Data Sessions, Seminars and Symposia. We argue in the following competitive renewal that success in each of these areas has been achieved, thereby helping to develop a new generation of young scientists who approach new scientific challenges with analytical minds and an extensive array of modern technologies.      \",\n",

During our current award period the Program has continued to gain in importance and recognition, both at WSU and beyond. The success of the BTP is based on many factors including the continuous and generous support provided by our University. Since its founding, WSU has contributed significant funding directly to the Program for a number of purposes including to supplement support of NIH-funded Trainees, to support additional non- NIH funded Trainees, to hire a part-time BTP project specialist, to assist with student recruitment and retention, and to fund various other Program activities. For this renewal application Washington State University has not only pledged to continue, but to significantly expand, this support. A major factor that has led to these commitments to the BTP is the fact that, over the years, the Training Faculty has continuously strived to refine and improve the quality of the Program and its offerings in order to meet the ever-changing needs of the biotechnology sector and provide the best possible education for our Trainees. As we enter our twentieth-fourth year of operation, greater interest and support than ever for the Program is evident among the Trainees, the Training Faculty and the University, providing clear evidence of our success in developing a robust and thriving training program.

This interdisciplinary and interdepartmental Program draws students from five participating units: the Departments of Biological & Chemical Engineering (ChBE), Biomedical Engineering (BME), Material Sciences & Engineering (MSE), Chemistry (Chem), and the Interdepartmental Biological Sciences (IBiS) graduate program. Research opportunities, chosen from among a selection of laboratories in the life sciences, are complemented by a core interdisciplinary curriculum. Instruction in the responsible conduct of research is carried out primarily through the course, Ethics in Biological Research. Three- to 6-month industrial internships expose trainees to the industrial environment of modern biotechnology. All trainees and many preceptors participate in the IBiS, 2- day, off-campus annual retreat, which allows extensive interactions among students and faculty from many disciplines and increases the cohesiveness of the trainee group. The Biotechnology Research in Progress Meetings occur monthly and is the forum where trainees and faculty present and discuss their research results and interact with other trainees. Trainees organize and host a Biotechnology Seminar Series that bring industrial and academic scientists to campus for discussions with trainees. Additionally, the trainees organize a Biotechnology Practicum and Biotechnology Day. The practicum provides hands-on training in current and emerging biotechnologies, whereas Biotechnology Day introduces trainees and broader biotechnology community to numerous representatives from industry, who can answer questions and discuss their career paths and strategies for navigating the opportunities and challenges in industry. An Individual Development Plan is one component of several available professional development options that are available to the trainees. Trainees are recruited by the Program through extensive advertising in the Seminar Series, email announcements, brochures, and web pages. Intensive efforts are made to recurit student from underrepresented groups, and have been quite successful with 25% of trainees from the past 4 years from underrepresented groups. The Steering Committee has been effective in selecting trainees from all participating departments, and distributing the trainees among the available preceptors. Importantly, Northwestern University is providing significant resources to the program. The Graduate School provides 5 additional 1-year training slots along with tuition supplements, and the McCormick School of Engineering and the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering contribute stipend supplements, administrative support, and operating funds. Based on the size of quality of the student pool interested in biotechnology, we have requested an increase from 6 to 8 funded positions.\",\n",

As human culture has progressed, we have utilized plants in increasingly sophisticated ways, progressing from breeding- based agriculture through discovery of modern medicines and most recently using biotechnology. We now look to plants to address global issues such as the sustainable production of fuels to mitigate the environmental impacts of fossil fuels. Plant diversity is enormous and relatively litte of the chemical repertoire of plants has been recognized and utilized. Plant biotechnology has the potential to meet many of the current challenges threatening human wellbeing, but maintaining or improving the health of a growing world population against a backdrop of a changing environment will require that plant scientists receive innovative and cross-disciplinary training. The goal of the Plant Biotechnology for Health and Sustainability (PBHS) predoctoral training program is to foster the education, training, and professional development of the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists who will assume leadership positions in health and sustainability-related biotechnology careers, including academia, industry, government, and entrepreneurship. A set of core competencies will be emphasized including integrating a broad set of content areas related to health and reduced environmental impacts, developing critical thinking, and honing communication skills essential for effective collaboration across disciplines.Trainees will be exposed to the full biotechnology pipeline from basic research to commercialization. Emphasis will be placed on building specific skill sets designed to promote personal and professional development and provide a basis for evaluation of trainee performance.  Bachelor's and master's degree level trainees will enter the PBHS program at the end of the second semester of predoctoral training. During the second year of predoctoral work, trainees will take three courses that introduce concepts in plant biotechnology, collaborative and quantitative research and that describe paths for translation of basic research into commercial products. The program will provide stipends to three to seven students at a time for two years each; these NRSA-funded students will be joined by one to two Michigan State University Graduate School-funded students.\",\n",

This training will focus on translating academic research into relevant medical technology and products and will expose students to a variety of biomedical career opportunities beyond academic research. The goals of the BLP are to train the next generation of biotechnology leaders by i) introducing students to different caree options, ii) introducing students specifically to industry-focused biomedical research, and iii) informing students about important nonscientific concerns that govern the translation of academic research projects into commercial products, including financial, regulatory, ethical, and legal issues that can accompany product or technology development and implementation. With 21 outstanding faculty from three Caltech Divisions, Caltech's interdisciplinary BLP will focus on micro- and nano-medicine due to Caltech's strength in this area, its importance for the future of health, and the huge opportunities for technology development. The BLP will support trainees for interdisciplinary research developing molecular sensors and controllers, (low cost) microscale/nanoscale medical diagnostics, and microscale/nanoscale therapeutic materials and prosthetics. Many of the training faculty and their students have developed products for human health and successfully translated their research to industry; this BLP will build upon this exceptional Caltech track record to train the next generation. The BLP will draw trainees from PhD programs in bioengineering, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, computer science, electrical engineering, neurobiology, and medical engineering. Trainees will be required to take specific courses in mathematics, biochemistry or physiology, entrepreneurship, and responsible conduct of research. They will intern in industry during their training, and will participate in program activities that include visits to innovative companies, seminars from industrial leaders, and training in entrepreneurship. Collaborations with industry and among different research groups will be encouraged. The BLP will support 8 trainees per year (six with NIH funds, two from Caltech funds); students on other support (e.g. outside fellowships) will also participate in the program. We expect the BLP to provide new opportunities to recruit and train exceptional under-represented minority, disadvantaged and disabled students for leadership roles in micro/nanomedicine.\",\n",

Due to the difficulty and complex nature of developing biotechnology-derived drugs, it is necessary to train a new 'breed' of pharmaceutical scientists who can respond to the need for interdisciplinary approaches for the advancement of biological, chemical, and pharmaceutical sciences by integrating mathematics, physics, biology, molecular biology, and chemistry to solve difficult problems in designing therapeutic agents of the future. This new type of scientist could also be employed in academic institutions to expand the educational training of future pharmaceutical biotechnology scientists. This training program has been in existence for 26 years with 37 faculty mentors and eight students will be in the training program. There are three major areas of research in this training program: (1) the traditional 'pharmaceutics' area that includes formation, analysis, and delivery, (2) the protein structure and bioinformatics area, and (3) the vaccine stabilization and formulation area. The 37 faculty mentors are from various departments (e.g., Chemistry, Medicinal Chemistry, Mechanical Engineering, Molecular Biosciences, and Pharmaceutical Chemistry, etc.) and Centers (Adams Institute for Bioanalytical Chemistry, Bioengineering and Bioinformatics Centers). The Steering Committee oversees all aspects of the Biotechnology Training Program; Drs. Siahaan and Volkin serve as the PI and Co-PI of the program, respectively. The students will be selected from a pool of applicants that are nominated by the faculty mentors from the participating departments. The Steering Committee will select the trainees from the nominated students each year. The trainees have to take required and elective courses for the training program including a course on responsible conduct in research. The students are also required to do 3-6 months industrial internship. The students' progress will be monitored in quarterly meetings and annual KU retreat. The trainees organize the Joint CU-KU Symposia, which is a joint symposium with the Biotechnology Training Program at the University of Colorado. The trainees will be supported by the training program for a maximum of two years. The alumni of this program who have been working for five years in industry and academia will be invited to present their research at the yearly KU retreat as well as to provide feedback on the training program.\",\n",

Biotechnology is broadening and maturing as a field with an expansion of knowledge, methods, and applications. In parallel, industry has been shaping a new field focused on biotechnology for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. Now, more than ever before, interdisciplinary training and awareness is critically needed for biotechnologists to be optimally productive and to make an impact on the world. Stanford provides an unusually rich biotechnology environment, with co- located, nationally ranked schools devoted to basic science, engineering, and medicine, and a strong industrial presence from the surrounding Bay Area. We will leverage this environment to train talented students who will become the next-generation of global biotechnology innovators and leaders. The program fuses 28 investigators from 8 departments across the university into a highly visible program to deliver a rich, applications-oriented training experience that is uniquely focused on health-related biotechnology. Many unique features differentiate this training program, including rich curricular offerings, industrial internships, field trips, biotechnology symposia, and regular and detailed interactions with other trainees and with academic and industrial mentors. Guided by input from faculty, trainees, NIH officials, and industrial affiliates, we evolved a more cohesive training program by implementing a sharper focus on synthetic biology, pharmaceutical discovery and development, and advancements in tools and technologies related to these areas. This evolution recognizes dramatic faculty expansion and new initiatives at Stanford toward these pursuits and has motivated major changes in preceptor appointment to the training program.      \",\n",

BTP students in training (15) or graduated (47) entered with an average undergraduate GPA of 3.70, currently include 2 minorities and 1 financially disadvantaged, and are hosted by 6 different departments. Over the course of the existence of the UVA BTP, trainees and graduates (19%    minority or disadvantaged) have received multiple awards, experienced 51 different externships from 38 different companies, and after graduation are now employed in industry (22), academia (14; including 4 Ass't and 1 Assoc Professors), government (3), medicine (5), or foundation (1). One is a company president, two are Directors at GSK and Amgen, and another is an NSF Deputy Director. Since '05, 75 first author articles have been published in journals with impact factors as high as 24. Trainees have taken direct responsibility for programmatic features of the BTP including: BTP Symposia and Seminars, BTP Day of Caring, BTP Industrial Q&A Panels and BTP company tours. Mentoring our trainees is a highly engaged, collaborative and well-funded faculty of 42 individuals from 15 departments. Institutional support has been essential for our success, including Vice President for Research in help with externship and Symposia funding, and an additional training slot funded by the School of Engineering. We view the BTP's mission as threefold: (i) most importantly to train our students to be exceptional scientists who will ultimately contribute to society in diverse professional positions in biotechnology, (ii) to provide a meaningful experience in industrial science via our externship program, and (iii) to promote scientific synergy among BTP students of different disciplines through regular BTP Journal Clubs/Data Sessions, Seminars and Symposia. We argue in the following competitive renewal that success in each of these areas has been achieved, thereby helping to develop a new generation of young scientists who approach new scientific challenges with analytical minds and an extensive array of modern technologies.\",\n",

The American Heritage Dictionary defines Biotechnology as: 'The application of the principles of engineering and technology to the life sciences; bioengineering.' Information productively flows in both directions: new technologies enable the discovery of new biology, and the discovery of new biology enables new technologies. The MIT BTP encompasses research in the fields of Bioprocess Engineering, Metabolic Engineering, Tissue Engineering, Biomolecular Design, Cellular Bioengineering, BioMEMS, Systems Biology, and more. A major aim of the MIT BTP is to broaden the students' graduate training by a program that repeatedly puts them in close contact with students and faculty from other disciplines.  Trainees are appointed at the end of their first year of graduate studies, and their stipend is supported by the BTP for three years, during which they complete the following requirements: i) a) two biotechnology courses outside their home department and b) one interdisciplinary course from a restricted list; ii) Monthly BTP meetings for research updates; iii) Attendance & poster presentation at an Annual Retreat, one full day in April; iv) Training in responsible conduct of research; and v) An industrial internshipof 2-3 months.  At present 19 predoctoral trainees are appointed to the program at any given time, but given the strong nominee pool and only a 58% success rate for highly qualified nominations to the program, an increase in support to 22 trainees is requested.  Over 200 trainees have benefited from the program during the 24 years of existence of the NIGMS/MIT BTP, and many have risen to positions of prominence in both academics and industry. We contacted selected alumni of the program to gain their perspectives on the influence the BTP had on their career development, and numerous successful individuals cite this highly interdisciplinary program and peer network as a critical formative experience. Excerpts of these comments are included in this proposal.\",\n",

This not only facilitates completion of the students' dissertation research, but also lays the basis for career opportunities in academic, government and industrial research settings. Using this campus educational resource as a framework, NC State University proposes to continue a graduate level training program in molecular biotechnology that will involve students from at least 4 colleges and 12 university departments. Seven trainee slots are requested for the next training period, which will be augmented by 3 slots funded from university resources. The program requirements include completing: (1) a graduate level, laboratory minor in molecular biotechnology; (2) an off--campus industrial internship; (3) a capstone biotechnology design course; (4) a course in professional development; (5) a course in research ethics; (6) an annual research symposium; and, (7) a biotechnology--related service project.

BTP trainees are recruited from Chemical & Biological Engineering, Chemistry, Integrated Program in Biochemistry, Microbiology Doctoral Training Program and 15 other excellent doctoral programs, allowing access to ~1300 prospective training-grant eligible applicants each year. Members of the Steering Committee and established BTP trainers serve on PhD program admissions committees and forward their very best applicants to the BTP Steering committee, which further reviews this highly select group for academic excellence, stated interest in interdisciplinary training, previous career activities, future aspirations, and program balance, and then offers BTP support to a subset of these diverse and highly qualified nominees.  During the first year of our program, all BTP trainees participate as a cohort in (1) the BTP-originated Foundations of Biotechnology course and (2) complete the BTP-led Responsible Conduct of Research course. Also starting in the first year, and continuing throughout their three-year training period, all BT trainees participate in (3) the BTP-led Biotechnology Seminar as both presenters and participants, the (4) Winter Banquet, and the biannual (5) Evening Forum. At the end of the first semester of graduate studies, BTP trainees pick a thesis advisor, who must be an approved BTP trainer. During the remainder of the first and second years, every BTP trainee is required to (6) produce an individual training plan with their PhD mentor, (7) identify a BTP minor Professor from another discipline to serve on his or her dissertation committee and monitor their progress in the BTP, (8) develop and complete a BTP-approved biotechnology-oriented minor degree plan, and (9) defend his or her thesis research in a preliminary exam during the spring or summer of their second year. During the third year of support, corresponding to the preference of our industrial partners for interns with advanced skills, BTP trainees undertake (10) an internship and take another BTP-approved Responsible Conduct of Research course to complete their training. In this revised proposal, we describe the establishment of a formal relationship with University Research Park to provide additional opportunities for our trainees to complete their required internship.  The training experiences described above ensure that all BTP trainees have an enhanced educational experience and ample opportunities beyond those provided by their PhD degree programs to become conversant in the principles of chemistry, biology, engineering and quantitative sciences, to take a breadth of courses to support this, and to develop additional professional speaking, writing and planning skills required to become leading cross-disciplinary scientists and engineers in the biotechnology field.\",\n",

As a discipline, marine biotechnology has seen considerable advancement in recent years with an increasing number of valuable products being derived from or inspired by marine life forms.  Hence, this TP has the goal of training a diverse workforce with the appropriate multidisciplinary education to work at the confluence of marine science, organic chemistry, biochemistry, pharmacology, genomics, cell biology, and computational science. In this immediately past cycle of 4 years, we demonstrated that the program could operate as envisioned by both the TP leadership and the NIH with a superb group of highly talented and enthusiastic trainees, one---third of whom are members of underrepresented minority groups.  These trainees are  participating in a robust curriculum in Marine Biotechnology, involved in a student---run invited seminar  speaker program and year---end research retreat, have completed their Responsible Conduct in Research  training on time, and have engaged in the unique Industrial Internship feature of the program during  their period of NIH trainee support.  In this renewal application, four senior faculty no longer involved in  graduate student training have retired from the TP, and five new and diverse faculty in sciences related  to marine biotechnology have been added.  This Training Program has developed considerable campus recognition, and is highly appreciated and supported by campus administration, including generous matching funds as detailed in this proposal and support letters.  The proposed path forward for this TP in the next cycle involves additional solidification of the policies and procedures of this training program, further enhancement of our underrepresented minority and people with disabilities recruitment, and refinement of the running of the program with greater use of our External Advisory Committee and other participant feedback.\",\n",

This goal is achieved through a cohesive 2-year training program entailing multidisciplinary research, a common curriculum composed of formal coursework in life science and engineering and of a cross-disciplinary laboratory rotation, and an industrial internship. The required coursework is comprised of a course in macromolecular synthesis and structure, a course on molecular biotechnology from an engineer's perspective, the 'Biotechnology Forum' course, and a class in research ethics. Life science trainees must work in the research laboratory of an engineering mentor for at least three months; likewise the engineers spend time in the laboratory of their life science mentor. A biotechnology community is fostered principally through the monthly trainee lunch seminar series and the Annual Biotechnology Symposium, which brings together ~50 students, faculty and industry representatives. Trainees who complete this program will be equipped to function productively in the multidisciplinary teams of bioengineers and life scientists prevalent in the industry. The interface between the life/health sciences and engineering is extraordinarily rich in its diversity and this biotechnology program focuses broadly on molecular and cellular research. Faculty participants in the proposed BTBSE Program all mentor Ph.D. students who conduct research focused at the molecular and cellular level, and most have established cross-disciplinary collaborations. Three interconnected theme areas have been identified and are i) synthetic biology and metabolic engineering; ii) bionanotechnology and tissue engineering; and iii) Molecular, Cellular and Systems Biology. Such an array of research activities conducted by collaborating researchers provides an exciting menu of multidisciplinary research opportunities to trainees. Faculty participants in the proposed training program have had the opportunity to recruit from a pool of over 100 eligible Ph.D. students this academic year. The Director and faculty mentors are very active and successful in underrepresented minority student development and recruitment, especially from the very diverse, populous greater Los Angeles area. Several major changes are noted for this renewal application, including change of the program director to Prof. Yi Tang, turnover of ~20% of training faculty to increase collaboration and training participation, and reconstitution of the training committee members.\",\n",

During our current award period the Program has continued to gain in importance and recognition, both at WSU and beyond. The success of the BTP is based on many factors including the continuous and generous support provided by our University. Since its founding, WSU has contributed significant funding directly to the Program for a number of purposes including to supplement support of NIH-funded Trainees, to support additional non- NIH funded Trainees, to hire a part-time BTP project specialist, to assist with student recruitment and retention, and to fund various other Program activities. For this renewal application Washington State University has not only pledged to continue, but to significantly expand, this support. A major factor that has led to these commitments to the BTP is the fact that, over the years, the Training Faculty has continuously strived to refine and improve the quality of the Program and its offerings in order to meet the ever-changing needs of the biotechnology sector and provide the best possible education for our Trainees. As we enter our twentieth-fourth year of operation, greater interest and support than ever for the Program is evident among the Trainees, the Training Faculty and the University, providing clear evidence of our success in developing a robust and thriving training program. On this basis we enthusiastically apply for renewal of funding for 10 Trainees/year for the next five years.\",\n",

In this renewal application, we propose to continue our success in training future scientific leaders in biotechnology. The emphasis in the next grant period will be on the design and synthesis of biological systems for biotechnological applications. It is an area of critical importance to futur innovations and discoveries in biotechnology, and represents an area that is uniquely suited for the combined expertise of our training faculty. In addition to solid education in their traditionaldisciplines, trainees take two cross-disciplinary courses that teach quantitative approaches for biological questions: 'Mathematical Tools for Biotechnology' and 'Analysis and Synthesis of Biological Systems' course. We believe that future biotechnological engineers should be familiar with modern molecular biological experimental skills. Conversely, biotechnological scientists should have a sound appreciation of quantitative analysis of biological processes. Engineers and scientists alike must have a systems perspective to tackle biological processes in a post-genomic era. In addition, our trainees participate in a biology summer camp and in cross disciplinary workshops, symposia and retreats. Mechanisms are in place to expose trainees to 'real world' biotechnology perspectives through internships and other industrial interactions. We continue to emphasize cultural and racial diversity in our training program by implementing measures to facilitate inclusion of trainees from underrepresented groups. Mandatory training for responsible research conduct is in place. Furthermore, we will continue provide trainees with a global perspective through our international exchange program. The proposed training program will produce well rounded Ph.D. engineers and scientists to lead our country's biotechnology advances in future generations.\",\n",

The program provides 2 years of funding to meritorious students, with the contractual understanding that students will participate in all program activities for their entire graduate careers. The trainingexperience involves a unifying and multifaceted curriculum which includes: 1) specialized courses that provide the student with critical perspectives of the field from three different vantage points (academic research, industrial R&D, and new ventures); 2) summer industrial internships; 3) training in the responsible conduct of research; 4) an Annual Symposium; and 5) a Ph.D. dissertation research project in one of the laboratories of our 39 participating faculty mentors who are appointed in many different life science and engineering departments. We are requesting 10 NIH-funded predoctoral positions per year for 5 years. Rutgers has committed significant matching fellowship support, stipend and tuition supplements, and other administrative support. Industrial interaction is exceedingly strong, with industrial investigatorsparticipating in the teaching of courses, presenting at the Annual Symposium, hosting summer interns, providing matching support, serving on thesis committees, and occasionally hosting students for a part of their Ph.D. dissertation work. The participating graduate programs and departments, together with several biotechnology related centers provide exceptional facilities for comprehensive biomedical biotechnology research and education. Vigorous and extensive recruitment efforts are expended to attract applicants to the program, and only students of exceptional abilities and motivation are admitted. The program also vigorously recruits students from under-represented minorities into the biotechnology field with excellent success. Student progress is continuously monitored through progress reports (and via individual development plans in the future). These documents, as well as surveys of the students' progress in their careers after they leave the university will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the program. These efforts will continue unabated through the ongoing program, which will continue to produce professionals who are well-educated within a single discipline and have the cross-disciplinary skills needed to conduct independent research and development at the forefront of the constantly evolving discipline of biotechnology.\",\n",

OIB is strongly interdisciplinary, integrating basic scientists with technologists and clinicians and is focused around 3 key themes. Critically, each of the themes includes basic science, technology development, and translational research activities spanning from animal models to human subjects in various types of cancers, including breast, skin, GI, oral cavity, prostate, and brain. We also apply emerging technologies in multi-center and cooperative group clinical trials in order to standardize and validate methods and endpoints for improved cancer detection and clinical management. The three themes are: 1) Cancer imaging and treatment using Biophotonics and Biomedical Optics technologies, including a broad range of non-linear optical microscopies, Laser Microbeams, Optical Coherence Tomography, Acousto-Optic Imaging and Elastography, Laser Speckle Imaging, Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging, and Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy and Imaging; 2) Cancer imaging and treatment using MRI, Nuclear, X-Ray/CT, multi-Modality technologies; and 3) Cancer detection and therapy using molecular, cellular, and material technologies, from nano- and microfluidic platforms and integrated \\u201clab-on-a-chip\\u201d and \\u201cbody-on- a-chip\\u201d systems, to advanced cellular and molecular diagnostics for improved cancer detection and therapy. Importantly, the new technologies and methods for engineering cellular systems we are developing are optimized such that their integration into multi-system platforms allows visualization using many of the technologies developed in themes 1 and 2. OIB leadership works to leverage these technologies to improve cancer detection, clinical management and patient quality of life through three Specific Aims: 1) Develop novel tools for cancer detection and treatment; 2) Foster multi-disciplinary collaborations to validate these tools in preclinical cancer models; and, 3) Validate novel technologies in multi-center and cooperative group clinical trials.

These markers include biological cells, cell free DNA and exosomes and the molecular cargo they may possess that can be used to guide important clinical decisions for a number of important disease states. To accomplish the lofty goals envisioned by the Center, an accomplished multidisciplinary team of researchers has been assembled across several institutions that possess complementary skill sets. The Administration component of the Center seeks to coordinate activities between the Center's researchers to aggressively move the research program forward and in a focused manner so as to provide compelling outputs that will not only provide unique opportunities for the Center's Collaborative and Service Projects, but the biomedical community as a whole. The Center's leadership team is seasoned with extensive experiences in managing large research organizations that have demonstrated success within the research community as well as generating interesting training programs for a variety of audiences. The leadership team will coordinate not only the research efforts of the Center, but also its evolving Collaborative and Service projects to allow careful coordination between these projects and the TR&D activities to allow for application driven development of the proposed technologies. The design approach adopted by the Center (modular format) coupled with the extensive accomplishments already realized by the Center will allow for the rapid translation of the technology outputs into the biomedical community to facilitate the development process. Because this is a new P41 Center, it intrinsically has an evolving Collaborative and Service Program; the evolution of this Program will be enhanced by a far-reaching and compelling Training and Dissemination Program including a robust website and extensive networks provided by the leadership team.\",\n",

The topics discussed are comprehensive and address the major needs and questions necessary to realize the envisioned benefits of plastid biotechnology. The meeting will host graduate students, postdoctoral scientists and junior academics together with an international cadre of leading experts in the field. The emphasis on sharing previously unpublished information enables the cultivation of innovative approaches to address the most important challenges facing the field.Plastid engineering is driven by the expectation that plastid transgene expression precludes transgene flow vial pollen, because the inheritance of the transgene is limited to maternal parent.  The conference will be focused on topics such as: (1) expression of recombinant proteins for industrial and pharmaceutical applications; (2) engineering the plastid genome to improve photosynthetic efficiency and plant productivity; (3) engineering novel metabolic pathways and structures into chloroplasts; (4) engineering novel agronomic traits into chloroplasts for gene stacking and transgene containment.\",\n",
