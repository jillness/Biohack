      "            \"abstract\": \"The purpose of this project is to design and implement career pathways in biotechnology, specifically in agricultural science research technology. This includes the development of: 1) a biotechnology certificate program, which contains courses in agricultural science, with dual enrollment options; and 2) community information seminars/workshops on biotechnology. The primary target audiences include technical college students, high school students, individuals working in the biotechnology field, and residents of the region, including nearby communities.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Biotechnology is a rapidly advancing field, with new discoveries and applications that are changing the face of such diverse fields as agriculture, environmental remediation, forensics, and health care. The biosciences serve as the tools for many improvements to daily life often taken for granted. The college, through its Workforce and Community Development unit, conducted a review and analysis of existing agricultural science biotechnology training programs. Using this information, this model program in agricultural biotechnology has an emphasis on preparing students for employment in a biotechnology field and/or to continue their science education. The plans to accomplish this goal include mentoring and advisement, group study activities, and other academic interventions to increase the level of preparation of students in the critical classes for their majors. In addition, the project provides career counseling and internships that enhance academic experience and computer expertise of students in order to prepare them for the next step in their professional careers.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The college serves over 12,000 students each year in credit and non-credit education programs and offers degrees, diplomas, and certificates in some of the fastest growing career fields as it strives to deliver a competent workforce for current and future Lowcountry employers. A large percentage of the native population is currently under-employed and works at low wage service jobs, primarily in seasonal, tourism related enterprises. The resort climate is enticing both aging retirees and mobile executives to the region at exponential rates. These new residents comprise an economic sector that demands advanced biotechnology services in fields such as agriculture, forensics, pharmaceutics, biomedical and environmental fields. Several biotechnology firms as well as clinical, environmental, and forensics labs are operating within a one hundred mile radius of the college. The program is having a positive impact on student retention and graduation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) related disciplines. The evaluation of the program is based on the percentage of students who graduate and transfer to a four-year college with a STEM related major; percentage of students who graduate and find employment in the biotechnology field; increased enrollment in STEM disciplines; and the number of high school students who enroll in STEM programs at the college.\",\n",

BTP students in training (17) or graduated (23) entered with an average undergraduate GPA of 3.53, currently include 4 minorities, and are hosted by 6 different departments. Trainees have received multiple awards, have published 47 first author articles in journals with impact factors as high as 19, experienced 32 different externships from 21 different companies, and after graduation are now employed in industry (11), academia (7; including 3 Ass't Professors) or government (3). Two are completing med school. Trainees have taken direct responsibility for programmatic features of the BTP including: editorship ofthe BTP newsletter, organization of BTP Minority Day, organization of BTP seminars, social activities, new student dinner, and BTP Symposia. Mentoring our trainees is a highly engaged, collaborative and well-funded faculty of 50 individuals from 13 departments, 3 of which are ranked in the top 10 in NIH funding; another #15 by USN&WR. Institutional support has been essential for our success, particularly the important role of the Graduate Programs Office and more recently the Molec. Cell and Develop. Biology Office in day-to-day administration of the Program. Also important has been the enthusiastic joint organization of externships by Engineering Associate Dean and Health Science Translational Offices. We view the BTP's mission as threefold: (i) most importantly to train our students to do the best science possible, (ii) to provide a meaningful experience in industrial science via our externship program, and (iii) to promote scientific synergy among BTP students of different disciplines through regular BTP Journal Clubs/Data Sessions, Seminars and Symposia. We argue in the following competitive renewal that success in each of these areas has been achieved, thereby helping to develop a new generation of young scientists who approach new scientific challenges with analytical minds and an extensive array of  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We are developing a new generation of young scientists who approach new scientific challenges with analytical minds and an extensive array of modern technologies.

This program operates in close collaboration industry at both the local and national levels, and is currently supported by a broad-based group of corporate sponsors that leverage NIH support to provide interdisciplinary education in pharmaceutical biotechnology to graduate students in the University of Colorado's Departments of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Pharmaceutical Sciences, and Chemistry and Biochemistry. The Leadership in Pharmaceutical Biotechnology training program has seven major thrusts: 1. Lecture and laboratory coursework designed to provide a broad-based education in pharmaceutical biotechnology 2. Laboratory rotations 3. An industrial mentor program designed to enhance both recruitment and retention of students 4. A summer internship program with our industrial collaborators 5. Interdisciplinary thesis research 6. Leadership activities, including training in research ethics 7. Seminars and symposia. These seven thrusts enable students to be educated in practical issues in pharmaceutical biotechnology (e.g., intellectual property issues, regulatory affairs and basic business concepts) as well as multidisciplinary scientific ones. This prepares students to perform well when they take subsequent positions in industry, academia, or government. To make sure that our research is rooted in practical problems, we rely heavily on our industrial colleagues as a source of new challenges that we may attempt to address. Students benefit from experiential training in non-academic settings, gaining an appreciation of the ever-changing biomedical and pharmaceutical industries. We incorporate active participation of our industrial mentors, industrial internships, and industrial seminar speakers to achieve this non-academic training.  \",\n",

Recognizing this, NC State University has created a core education facility that serves campus-wide needs for graduate students requiring laboratory-based training in aspects of modern biology. This not only facilitates completion of the students' dissertation research, but also lays the basis for career opportunities in academic, government and industrial research settings. Using this campus educational resource as a framework, NC State University proposes to continue a graduate level training program in molecular biotechnology that will involve students from at least 4 colleges and 10 university departments. Ten trainee slots are requested for the next training period, which will be augmented by 4 slots funded from university resources. The program requirements include completing: (1) a graduate level, laboratory minor in molecular biotechnology; (2) an off-campus industrial internship; (3) a capstone biotechnology design course; (4) a course in professional development; (5) a course in research ethics; (6) an annual research symposium; and, (7) a biotechnology-related service project. These requirements are in addition to those associated with the student's particular department or program for the doctoral degree. This program will also provide a central focus for faculty of the various disciplines involved in this training effort to seek out new opportunities for formal and informal research collaboration.  RELEVANCE: Advanced training in molecular biotechnology is critical to modern medical science research and should be a key component of pre-doctoral education for students aspiring to academic, industrial, and government research setting.   \",\n",

Moreover, this training grant will provide collaborative cross-disciplinary research mentorship through training individual students in different laboratories in multiple departments on the UCSD campus as well as the Salk Institute and J. Craig Venter Institute. To accomplish this mission, the TP has the following objectives: (1) to provide new course offerings that create a unique curriculum on the UCSD campus that is the intellectual foundation for research in the multidisciplinary field of Marine Biotechnology (2) to provide a stimulating series of seminars by leaders in the field of Marine Biotechnology, and to develop skills in our trainees through special opportunities to arrange and host these visiting speakers (3) to provide Industrial Internships that broaden the educational base and technology perspective of our graduates (4) to provide opportunities to our trainees that develop their research presentation skills through an annual symposium, participation in various research and journal clubs, and participation at national and international conferences (5) to provide competitively awarded financial support to especially meritorious trainees for a 2-year period in recognition of their superior research efforts and talents. The rationale for this training program is the need to train students for the biotechnology industry as well as for academia with an integrated knowledge of marine systems and their unique chemical, biochemical, and genetic attributes. To our knowledge, this broad training platform is not offered at any other institution in the US, and thus our graduates are sought after to fill a unique need in industry and academia. The training is proposed for 6 predoctoral trainees in the first two years and 8 predoctoral trainees in the latter three years of the renewal period, supplemented by 2 or more university-supported trainees, to support students in their second and third year of their 5-year Ph.D. programs. The assembly of this faculty and research strength under the auspices of the TP in Marine Biotechnology is helping to create a unique, internationally recognized educational and research program at UCSD.  RELEVANCE: Marine organisms are an exceptional source of natural products with useful medical properties. Fully accessing these natural products is enhanced by an integrated chemical and genetic approach, which is inherently complex and multidisciplinary. UCSD has a unique assembly of academic and research programs which can train the next generation of scientists in these areas.  \",\n",

This goal is achieved through a cohesive 2-year training program entailing multidisciplinary research, a common curriculum composed of formal coursework in life science and engineering and of a cross-disciplinary laboratory rotation, and an industrial internship. The required coursework is comprised of a course in macromolecular synthesis and structure, a course on molecular biotechnology from an engineer's perspective, the 'Biotechnology Forum' course, and a class in research ethics. Life science trainees must work in the research laboratory of an engineering mentor for at least three months; likewise the engineers spend time in the laboratory of their life science mentor. A biotechnology community is fostered principally through the monthly trainee lunch seminar series and the Annual Biotechnology Symposium, which brings together ~50 students, faculty and industry representatives and is currently in its fourth successful installment. Trainees who complete this program will be equipped to function productively in the multidisciplinary teams of bioengineers and life scientists prevalent in the industry. The interface between the life/health sciences and engineering is extraordinarily rich in its diversity, and this biotechnology program focuses broadly on molecular and cellular research. Faculty participants in the proposed BTBSE Program all mentor PhD students who conduct research focused at the molecular and cellular level, and most have established cross-disciplinary collaborations. The faculty research activities cover a broad spectrum of basic biomedical research related to biotechnology including, enzyme biocatalysis, thermostable enzymes, metabolic engineering, DNA microarray technology, nitric oxide metabolism, molecular basis of neurodegenerative disease, biosensors, tissue engineering, anaerobe microbiology, vaults (protein nanocapsules), nanobiotechnology, bioinformatics, genomics, proteomics, protein molecular evolution, and incorporation of unnatural amino acids in recombinant proteins. Such an array of research activities conducted by collaborating researchers provides an exciting menu of multidisciplinary research opportunities to trainees. Faculty participants in the proposed training program have had the opportunity to recruit from a pool of 127 eligible PhD students (including 13 underrepresented minority students) this academic year. The Director and faculty mentors are very active and successful in underrepresented minority student development and recruitment, especially from the very diverse, populous greater Los Angeles area. It is planned to grow the program over the next several years to a trainee graduation rate of 6/year (12 in training/yr). In sum, UCLA provides the talented multidisciplinary faculty, bright and diverse students, resources for research, courses, and opportunities to interact with industry that are necessary to mount a successful biotechnology training program.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This program will educate and train outstanding PhD students in the application of the principles of life science and engineering to health related problems. After earning their degrees, most former trainees are expected to assume leadership roles in the biotechnology industry, which is focused on commercialization of pharmaceuticals and other health-related products.    \",\n",

Centrifugal precipitation chromatography, a new method invented at the National Institutes of Health and licensed by CC Biotech LLC, offers unique capabilities for the purification of large molecules. In gradients of salt or solvents, discrete fractionation of large molecules is possible, aided by centrifugal forces. This method is well adapted to proteins, DNA and many bio-polymers. In a flow-through centrifuge, proteins are held by a filtration membrane as they are precipitated by the eluting agents. The process of precipitation and re-dissolving is repeated many times, causing the components to separate from each other at their different rates in the process. Special eluting conditions can be created for many types of molecules. This project is aimed at manufacturing the instrument for the research laboratory market such that its use will develop novel purification methods to simplify the process for biotechnology products and additionally, develop parameters for scaling up in the industry.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A new technique of purification is centrifugal precipitation chromatography which is especially suitable for the large bio-molecules. As a result of this research, purification processes for new therapeutic biologics will be simplified, and the costs lowered, to provide very pure drugs and vaccines for healthcare. New manufacturing techniques will be applied to make an improved instrument for introduction on the market.      \",\n",

This interdisciplinary and interdepartmental Program offers biotechnology training opportunities for a select group of PhD students from five participating units: the Departments of Biological & Chemical Engineering (ChBE), Biomedical Engineering (BME), Material Sciences & Engineering (MSE), Chemistry (Chem), and the Interdepartmental Biological Sciences (IBiS) graduate program. Research opportunities, chosen from among a selection of laboratories in the life sciences, are complemented by a core interdisciplinary curriculum. Three- to 6-month industrial internships expose trainees to the industrial environment of modern biotechnology. All trainees and many preceptors participate in the IBiS, 2-day, off-campus annual retreat, which allows extensive interactions among students and faculty from many disciplines and increases the cohesiveness of the trainee group. The Biotechnology Research in Progress Meetings occur monthly and is the forum where trainees and faculty present and discuss their research results and interact with other trainees. Trainees organize and host a Biotechnology Seminar Series that bring industrial and academic scientists to campus for discussions with trainees. Students also take advantage of several other life sciences-related seminar programs on campus, notably the annual Kellogg Biotechnology Conference and seminars for the Master's in Biotechnology Program. Instruction in the responsible conduct of research is carried out primarily through the course, 'Ethics in Biological Research.' Trainees are recruited by the Program and the participating units using brochures, www pages, and conference presentations. Intensive efforts are made to recruit student from underrepresented groups, and have been quite successful with 30% of trainees from the past 4 years from underrepresented groups. Trainees have been selected from Chemistry, BME, ChBE, and IBiS, and we propose to add MSE for the renewal due to their efforts in biotechnology research and strength of the faculty and the graduate student pool. The number of preceptors participating in the Program will increase from 31 to 42. An increase from 6 to 8 funded positions is requested to support this expanded preceptor base and available student pool.      \",\n",

The Coordinating Committee also serves as the Executive Committee of the CBB, thereby insuring close coordination between the Training Program and the state-funded Center. An emphasis of the Training Program is the recruitment and training of a diverse cohort of trainees. This emphasis not only addresses national needs but also provides a more inclusive educational experience for the trainees.    Relevance:  Participating faculty laboratories provide trainees with a wide range of research opportunities in the biomedical sciences. Among these are investigations of environmentally friendly biocatalytic processes for chemical transformations, development of new antibiotics and Alzheimer's disease agents, biosensor development, and new approaches to gene delivery.      \",\n",

This program has brought together gifted trainees and faculty trainers from diverse disciplines that interface with biotechnology, and has created an innovative, interdisciplinary research and educational endeavor. In this renewal application, we propose to continue our success in training future scientific leaders in biotechnology. An emphasis in the next training grant period will be on the application of systems analysis approaches to biological processes. It is an area of critical importance to future innovations and discoveries in biotechnology, and represents an area that is uniquely suited for the combined expertise of our training faculty. During the next five years, we will intensify our interdisciplinary education and training by spearheading efforts to create new interdisciplinary courses 'Systems Analysis of Biological Processes' and 'Biological Mathematics', and to immerse our trainees in a Biology summer camp and in cross disciplinary workshops, symposia and retreats. Mechanisms are already in place to facilitate trainee's gaining practical 'real world' biotechnology perspectives through internships and other industrial interactions. We continue to emphasize cultural and racial diversity in our training program by implementing measures to facilitate inclusion of trainees from underrepresented racial groups. Specifically a summer visiting professor program is established to invite faculty members and the students to join the training program in the summer. Mandatory training for responsible research conduct is in place. Furthermore, we will continue to emphasize giving our trainees a global perspective through our international exchange program. The proposed training program will produce well rounded Ph.D. engineers and scientists to lead our country's biotechnology advances in future generations.      \",\n",

It has been providing graduate training in biotechnology to life scientists and engineers since 1989. A total of 56 students have graduated from the program and 69 have been provided summer internships at industrial research laboratories. This proposal requests nine (9) traineeships from the NIH for student participation in the ongoing training program. The training program guides the students in a unifying curriculum and provides specialized activities such as summer internships, an annual symposium and a seminar series. It benefits new and established faculty carrying out research and teaching in biotechnology and serves as a powerful recruiting tool in attracting outstanding students to the Universities involved. TheUniversities will provide matching fellowships throughout the grant award. Industrial support has also been obtained for student fellowships and a summer internship program that all students without significant industrial training participate in. We believe the program has successfully developed a broad base of support for a diverse group of outstanding students. The participating graduate programs and departments, together with the Center for Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine, and the Waksman institute, have exceptional facilities for biotechnology research and education. The training helps to meet national needs for personneltrained to apply the tools of engineering and the quantitative sciences to significant research problems in biology. The program has also attracted students from under-represented minorities into the biotechnology field and will continue to do so through this continuing program.\",\n",

It is administered by the interdisciplinary Institute of Biosciences and Bioengineering (IBB), with faculty mentors from biochemistry & cell biology, bioengineering, chemistry, and chemical & biomolecular engineering. The presence of this training program in IBB has been catalytic for interactions among faculty and students and has provided key support for education and research training activities. It has been central to development of a new Department of Bioengineering, with a top-10 ranked graduate program. The requested number of pre-doctoral trainees for the program is 12. The trainees are selected after their first year of graduate studies for a two-year appointment based on academic performance, assessment of their potential as researchers, and their interests in biotechnology. Emphasis is given to recruiting and retaining students from under-represented ethnic groups through outreach activities, targeted recruiting, and mentoring programs. Trainees in this program take a core of interdisciplinary coursework in biotechnology, including 'Foundations of Biotechnology', a course sequence developed specifically for this program. Students also take a course in Responsible Conduct of Research. Trainees participate in a leadership workshop and an industrial internship as well. Special seminars are attended by trainees, including some seminars focused on research in the industrial setting meant to help prepare them for success on their internships. An annual research retreat provides the trainees with the opportunity to interact with each other, faculty, and with executives from local biotechnology companies. The physical facilities that support this program are outstanding, all either recently constructed or renovated, and in 2008 the program will move to a new building, a collaborative center for biotechnology, jointly occupied by Rice, Baylor College of Medicine, and M.D. Anderson.      \",\n",

The four components of BBF are all important and synergistic. DMA Synthesis delivers error-free oligonucleotides, regular, modified, or fluorescent probes, overnight with full quality control, Quantitative Real-time PCR provides high sensitivity and accuracy gene expression quantitation and distinguishes regulation by alternate transcripts. Mass Spectrometry identifies the components of protein complexes and supports biochemical, biophysical, and drug research.Proteomics reveals the global protein changes and modifications in response to disease states or drug treatments and discovers secondary targets of cancer-causing mutations. Anthony T. Yeung, Ph.D., (Biomolecular Structure and Function) directs BBF to provide uniformly high quality products at the cutting edge of performance. This is accomplished by proactive user interactions, and external collaborations with the leaders in each discipline. The Facility is used by 53 peer-reviewed investigators with 130 grants involving all three FCCC Divisions. About 95% of its use is by investigators with peer-reviewed funding. During the last grant period, demands on DNA synthesis (700 oligonucleotides per month by 2003) and Mass Spectrometry (about 22 projects in 2003) have both doubled. In addition, new services of Quantitative Real-time PCR and Proteomics have been developed in BBF because they are critical technologies for cancer research and are used by 13 and 7 investigators, respectively. In 2003, DNA Synthesis has contributed to 48 peer-reviewed, funded investigators, Quantitative Real-time PCR, 14; Mass Spectrometry, 23; and Proteomics, 7.

Over the past five years, limited research capacity and very few refereed publications in the sciences have given way to seven devoted research labs, most in the biotechnology area, 6 refereed papers per year. Over 50 undergraduate students have been trained in biotechnology research. Currently, the Department of Natural Sciences has five full time faculty (28%) actively involved in research and publications. This is an outstanding start. We are at the tipping point of reaching a critical mass of researchers; of firmly establishing a research culture. With continued support, we hope to break 50% participating in research efforts. While we are making inroads to basic research, horizontal communication is lacking. We propose to channel our biotechnology focus to address minority health disparities such that most, if not all, researchers in the department have a common goal. This will fundamentally shift the research culture at Albany State, increasing collaboration among peers and creating a sustainable research platform. The project encourages novice faculty to participate in health disparities related research through release time support, development workshops. Health Disparities seminar series, professional meeting support, technical skill training workshops, proposal writing and refereed publication, workshops, research mentor support, community connection support, and instrumentation training support. External collaborators with health disparities expertise will play a major role to reshape the research focus. Perhaps most importantly, we seek to implement undergraduate enrichment programs which will provide students the skills, training, experience, tutoring, mentoring and opportunities, across the board, so that they may appreciate and can address minority health disparities through their careers and research.        \",\n",

This goal is achieved through a cohesive 2-year training program entailing multidisciplinary research, a common curriculum composed of formal coursework in life science and engineering and of a cross-disciplinary laboratory rotation, and an industrial internship. The required coursework is comprised of a course in macromolecular synthesis and structure, a course on molecular biotechnology from an engineer's perspective, the 'Biotechnology Forum' course, and a class in research ethics. Life science trainees must work in the research laboratory of an engineering mentor for at least three months; likewise the engineers spend time in the laboratory of their life science mentor. A biotechnology community is fostered principally through the monthly trainee lunch seminar series and the Annual Biotechnology Symposium, which brings together ~50 students, faculty and industry representatives and is currently in its fourth successful installment. Trainees who complete this program will be equipped to function productively in the multidisciplinary teams of bioengineers and life scientists prevalent in the industry. The interface between the life/health sciences and engineering is extraordinarily rich in its diversity, and this biotechnology program focuses broadly on molecular and cellular research. Faculty participants in the proposed BTBSE Program all mentor PhD students who conduct research focused at the molecular and cellular level, and most have established cross-disciplinary collaborations. The faculty research activities cover a broad spectrum of basic biomedical research related to biotechnology including, enzyme biocatalysis, thermostable enzymes, metabolic engineering, DNA microarray technology, nitric oxide metabolism, molecular basis of neurodegenerative disease, biosensors, tissue engineering, anaerobe microbiology, vaults (protein nanocapsules), nanobiotechnology, bioinformatics, genomics, proteomics, protein molecular evolution, and incorporation of unnatural amino acids in recombinant proteins. Such an array of research activities conducted by collaborating researchers provides an exciting menu of multidisciplinary research opportunities to trainees. Faculty participants in the proposed training program have had the opportunity to recruit from a pool of 127 eligible PhD students (including 13 underrepresented minority students) this academic year. The Director and faculty mentors are very active and successful in underrepresented minority student development and recruitment, especially from the very diverse, populous greater Los Angeles area. It is planned to grow the program over the next several years to a trainee graduation rate of 6/year (12 in training/yr).

During our current award period the Program has continued to gain in importance and recognition, both at the local WSU level and beyond. The success of the Program is based on many factors, one of which has been the continuous and generous support provided by both our University and by the State of Washington. For this renewal the University has not only pledged to continue its support but to significantly increase its level of contribution. A major factor that has led to these University and State commitments is the fact that, over the years, the Training Faculty has continuously strived to refine and improve the quality of the Program and its offerings in order to meet the ever-changing needs of the biotechnology sector and provide the best possible education for our Trainees. As we enter our twentieth year of operation, greater than ever interest and support for the Program is evident among the Trainees, the Training Faculty and the University, providing clear evidence of our success in developing a robust and thriving training program. On this basis we enthusiastically apply for renewal of funding for 10 Trainee positions/year for the next five years.    The biotechnology industry in the United States has now surpassed pharmaceutical companies as the primary source of new drugs and medicines for the fourth straight year. Furthermore, biotechnology is designated as a high growth industry by the U.S. Department of Labor which projects double digit annual increases in the number of professional and technical jobs in this area through 2012 and beyond. Our Training Program is designed to address these current and future needs by providing interdisciplinary graduate training in biotechnology with a major emphasis on the fundamentals and complexities of protein biochemistry and its derivative science, proteomics.      \",\n",

Moreover, this training grant will provide collaborative cross-disciplinary research mentorship through training individual students in different laboratories in multiple departments on the UCSD campus as well as the Salk Institute and J. Craig Venter Institute. To accomplish this mission, the TP has the following objectives: (1) to provide new course offerings that create a unique curriculum on the UCSD campus that is the intellectual foundation for research in the multidisciplinary field of Marine Biotechnology (2) to provide a stimulating series of seminars by leaders in the field of Marine Biotechnology, and to develop skills in our trainees through special opportunities to arrange and host these visiting speakers (3) to provide Industrial Internships that broaden the educational base and technology perspective of our graduates (4) to provide opportunities to our trainees that develop their research presentation skills through an annual symposium, participation in various research and journal clubs, and participation at national and international conferences (5) to provide competitively awarded financial support to especially meritorious trainees for a 2-year period in recognition of their superior research efforts and talents. The rationale for this training program is the need to train students for the biotechnology industry as well as for academia with an integrated knowledge of marine systems and their unique chemical, biochemical, and genetic attributes. To our knowledge, this broad training platform is not offered at any other institution in the US, and thus our graduates are sought after to fill a unique need in industry and academia. The training is proposed for 6 predoctoral trainees in the first two years and 8 predoctoral trainees in the latter three years of the renewal period, supplemented by 2 or more university-supported trainees, to support students in their second and third year of their 5-year Ph.D. programs. The assembly of this faculty and research strength under the auspices of the TP in Marine Biotechnology is helping to create a unique, internationally recognized educational and research program at UCSD.     RELEVANCE: Marine organisms are an exceptional source of natural products with useful medical properties. Fully accessing these natural products is enhanced by an integrated chemical and genetic approach, which is inherently complex and multidisciplinary. UCSD has a unique assembly of academic and research programs which can train the next generation of scientists in these areas.       \",\n",

BTP students in training (17) or graduated (23) entered with an average undergraduate GPA of 3.53, currently include 4 minorities, and are hosted by 6 different departments. Trainees have received multiple awards, have published 47 first author articles in journals with impact factors as high as 19, experienced 32 different externships from 21 different companies, and after graduation are now employed in industry (11), academia (7; including 3 Ass't Professors) or government (3). Two are completing med school. Trainees have taken direct responsibility for programmatic features of the BTP including: editorship ofthe BTP newsletter, organization of BTP Minority Day, organization of BTP seminars, social activities, new student dinner, and BTP Symposia. Mentoring our trainees is a highly engaged, collaborative and well-funded faculty of 50 individuals from 13 departments, 3 of which are ranked in the top 10 in NIH funding; another #15 by USN&WR. Institutional support has been essential for our success, particularly the important role of the Graduate Programs Office and more recently the Molec. Cell and Develop. Biology Office in day-to-day administration of the Program. Also important has been the enthusiastic joint organization of externships by Engineering Associate Dean and Health Science Translational Offices. We view the BTP's mission as threefold: (i) most importantly to train our students to do the best science possible, (ii) to provide a meaningful experience in industrial science via our externship program, and (iii) to promote scientific synergy among BTP students of different disciplines through regular BTP Journal Clubs/Data Sessions, Seminars and Symposia.

These activities include: (1) course work and research in biotechnology-related disciplines, (2) monthly student dinner meetings at which research is discussed in an informal setting designed to encourage meaningful interactions, (3) a biotechnology core course designed to provide a background to a number of the disciplines composing biotechnology, (4) seminars by outside speakers co-sponsored with the allied programs and departments that provide exposure to leading scientists in academia and industry, (5) internships and other interactions with the biotechnology industry, (6) faculty presentations with a social hour, and (7) a yearly symposium with a poster session for faculty and students with a speaker usually from industry.    Students participating in CBTP are drawn from a variety of departments and programs, including: Chemistry, Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology (MCDB), Cell and Developmental Biology, Bioengineering, Biological Chemistry, Human Genetics, Microbiology and Immunology, Biomedical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Physiology. CBTP continues a longstanding relationship with Pfizer. Meaningful student interactions continue to be a centerpiece of CBTP. The highlight of these interactions is the monthly dinner-research meetings. Because the Program strives to maintain a student body from diverse disciplines, these meetings provide a forum for students to learn how training in other disciplines influences scientific thinking and how to interact productively with scientists trained in different disciplines. The strength of CBTP has been recognized by the University as evidenced by the significant financial support it receives and by its designation as a certificate-granting program.      \",\n",

Initially focused on the production of protein biopharmaceuticals, the BTP's scope has expanded along with the generally accepted meaning of the term Biotechnology. In addition to bioprocess development, Biotechnology now includes discovery activities aimed at understanding disease processes and designing new drugs. BTP training faculty is actively engaged in a broad spectrum of biotechnology research - for example, bioinformatics, tissue engineering, biomolecular design, toxicology, and glycomics. For the purposes of the BTP, Biotechnology can be distinguished from basic life science research both for its applied, goal-oriented flavor, and a quantitative, engineering approach to utilizing and developing new technologies. 19 BTP trainees are currently supported by the BTP, and each serves a 3-year tenure in the program, commencing in the 2nd year of their Ph.D. graduate studies. Trainees are primarily drawn from the graduate programs of the departments of Biological Engineering, Chemistry, and Chemical Engineering. To meet the goals of the BTP, interdisciplinary training is provided in the form of a 2-3 month off-site industrial internship, cross-departmental coursework, a Meet-the-Lab seminar series, an annual BTP retreat, once- per-semester pizza luncheons, and training in the responsible conduct of research. Complete information on the operation and activities of the BTP are made available to all trainees at http://web.mit.edu/bpec/biotech/. BTP alumni have achieved noteworthy successes in the Biotechnology industry as well as in faculty positions. Appointment to the BTP is extremely competitive, with only a 53% success rate for nominations. We are therefore requesting an increase in support to 22 positions, to provide this cross-disciplinary training to a greater number of these deserving candidates. Relevance: This Biotechnology Training Program provides a unique and valuable interdisciplinary training experience in Biotechnology for Ph.D. life scientists and engineers, preparing them to contribute to the Biotechnology industry that is the primary engine of innovation in developing new drugs and therapeutic technologies.       \",\n",

The four components of BBF are all important and synergistic. DMA Synthesis delivers error-free oligonucleotides, regular, modified, or fluorescent probes, overnight with full quality control, Quantitative Real-time PCR provides high sensitivity and accuracy gene expression quantitation and distinguishes regulation by alternate transcripts. Mass Spectrometry identifies the components of protein complexes and supports biochemical, biophysical, and drug research.Proteomics reveals the global protein changes and modifications in response to disease states or drug treatments and discovers secondary targets of cancer-causing mutations. Anthony T. Yeung, Ph.D., (Biomolecular Structure and Function) directs BBF to provide uniformly high quality products at the cutting edge of performance. This is accomplished by proactive user interactions, and external collaborations with the leaders in each discipline. The Facility is used by 53 peer-reviewed investigators with 130 grants involving all three FCCC Divisions. About 95% of its use is by investigators with peer-reviewed funding. During the last grant period, demands on DNA synthesis (700 oligonucleotides per month by 2003) and Mass Spectrometry (about 22 projects in 2003) have both doubled. In addition, new services of Quantitative Real-time PCR and Proteomics have been developed in BBF because they are critical technologies for cancer research and are used by 13 and 7 investigators, respectively. In 2003, DNA Synthesis has contributed to 48 peer-reviewed, funded investigators, Quantitative Real-time PCR, 14; Mass Spectrometry, 23; and Proteomics, 7. BBF personnel have in-depth understanding of the science of the users and facilitate their research as highly integrated tools and participants of these research programs.\",\n",

This interdisciplinary and interdepartmental Program offers biotechnology training opportunities for a select group of PhD students from five participating units: the Departments of Biological & Chemical Engineering (ChBE), Biomedical Engineering (BME), Material Sciences & Engineering (MSE), Chemistry (Chem), and the Interdepartmental Biological Sciences (IBiS) graduate program. Research opportunities, chosen from among a selection of laboratories in the life sciences, are complemented by a core interdisciplinary curriculum. Three- to 6-month industrial internships expose trainees to the industrial environment of modern biotechnology. All trainees and many preceptors participate in the IBiS, 2-day, off-campus annual retreat, which allows extensive interactions among students and faculty from many disciplines and increases the cohesiveness of the trainee group. The Biotechnology Research in Progress Meetings occur monthly and is the forum where trainees and faculty present and discuss their research results and interact with other trainees. Trainees organize and host a Biotechnology Seminar Series that bring industrial and academic scientists to campus for discussions with trainees. Students also take advantage of several other life sciences-related seminar programs on campus, notably the annual Kellogg Biotechnology Conference and seminars for the Master's in Biotechnology Program. Instruction in the responsible conduct of research is carried out primarily through the course, 'Ethics in Biological Research.' Trainees are recruited by the Program and the participating units using brochures, www pages, and conference presentations. Intensive efforts are made to recruit student from underrepresented groups, and have been quite successful with 30% of trainees from the past 4 years from underrepresented groups. Trainees have been selected from Chemistry, BME, ChBE, and IBiS, and we propose to add MSE for the renewal due to their efforts in biotechnology research and strength of the faculty and the graduate student pool. The number of preceptors participating in the Program will increase from 31 to 42. An increase from 6 to 8 funded positions is requested to support this expanded preceptor base and available student pool.      \",\n",

Due to the difficulty and complex nature of developing biotechnology derived drugs, it is necessary to train a new 'breed' of pharmaceutical scientists who can respond to the needs of interdisciplinary approaches for the advancements of biological, chemical, and pharmaceutical sciences by integrating mathematics, physics, biology, molecular biology, and chemistry to solve difficult problems in designing therapeutic agents of the future. This new type of scientist could also be placed in academic institutions to expand the educational training of pharmaceutical biotechnology scientists of the future. This training program has been in existence for 20 years with 8 students per year and 34 faculty mentors. There are two major areas of research in this training program: (1) the traditional 'Pharmaceutics' area that includes formation, analysis, and delivery and (2) the protein structure and bioinformatics area. The 34 faculty mentors are from four different departments, including Chemistry, Medicinal Chemistry, Molecular Biosciences, and Pharmaceutical Chemistry. The faculty mentors are also involved in several other programs within The University of Kansas, including the Adams Institute for Bioanalytical Chemistry, the Bioengineering Program, the Bioinformatics Center, and the Center of Excellence for Protein Structure and Function. The Steering Committee oversees all aspects of the training program and Dr. Siahaan (PI) serves as the committee chair. The students will be selected from a pool of applicants that are nominated by the faculty mentors from the participating departments. The Steering Committee will select the trainees from the nominated students each year. The students' progress will be monitored in quarterly meetings and annual symposia organized by the trainees under the supervision of a member of the Steering Committee. The trainees will be supported by the training program for a maximum of two years and the past trainees who are not yet graduated are expected to participate in all activities administered by the training program. The alumni of this program who have been working for five years in industry and academia will be invited to present their research at the yearly symposium. The alumni will provide feedback on the training program and the feedback will be used to improve the quality of the training program in the future. Relevance: The objective of this program is to train pharmaceutical scientists to handle the development of products arising from biotechnology research. This training program is fulfilling the need to produce a new 'breed' of future scientists that can respond to the complex nature of discovering and developing therapeutic agents derived from biotechnology research. The hope is that these future scientists will improve the probability of success in developing these future therapeutic agents from the bench to the bedside.         \",\n",

Research opportunities,chosen from among a selection of laboratories in the life sciences, are complemented by a coreinterdisciplinary curriculum. Three- to 6-month industrial internships expose trainees to the industrialenvironment of modern biotechnology. All trainees and many preceptors participate in the IBiS, 2-day, off-campus annual retreat, which allows extensive interactions among students and faculty from manydisciplines and increases the cohesiveness of the trainee group. The Biotechnology Research in ProgressMeetings occur monthly and is the forum where trainees and faculty present and discuss their researchresults and interact with other trainees. Trainees organize and host a Biotechnology Seminar Series thatbring industrial and academic scientists to campus for discussions with trainees. Students also takeadvantage of several other life sciences-related seminar programs on campus, notably the annual KelloggBiotechnology Conference and seminars for the Master's in Biotechnology Program. Instruction in theresponsible conduct of research is carried out primarily through the course, 'Ethics in Biological Research.'Trainees are recruited by the Program and the participating units using brochures, www pages, andconference presentations. Intensive efforts are made to recurit student from underrepresented groups, andhave been quite successful with 30% of trainees from the past 4 years from underrepresented groups.Trainees have been selected from Chemistry, BME, ChBE, and IBiS, and we propose to add MSE for therenewal due to their efforts in biotechnology reseaerch and strength of the faculty and the graduate studentpool. The number of preceptors participating in the Program will increase from 31 to 42. An increase from 6to 8 funded positions is requested to support this expanded preceptor base and available student pool.\",\n",

This proposal requests nine (9) traineeships from the NIH for student participation in the ongoing training program. The training program guides the students in a unifying curriculum and provides specialized activities such as summer internships, an annual symposium and a seminar series. It benefits new and established faculty carrying out research and teaching in biotechnology and serves as a powerful recruiting tool in attracting outstanding students to the Universities involved. TheUniversities will provide matching fellowships throughout the grant award. Industrial support has also been obtained for student fellowships and a summer internship program that all students without significant industrial training participate in. We believe the program has successfully developed a broad base of support for a diverse group of outstanding students. The participating graduate programs and departments, together with the Center for Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine, and the Waksman institute, have exceptional facilities for biotechnology research and education. The training helps to meet national needs for personneltrained to apply the tools of engineering and the quantitative sciences to significant research problems in biology.

This goal will be achieved through a cohesive training program entailing multidisciplinary research, a common curriculum composed of formal coursework in life science and engineering and of research seminars, and an industrial internship. The required coursework is comprised of a course in macromolecular structure, a course on molecular biotechnology from an engineer's perspective, the Biotechnology Forum seminar course, and a class in research ethics. Life science trainees must work in the research laboratory of an engineering mentor for at least three months; likewise the engineers will spend time in the laboratory of their life science mentor. Trainees who complete this program will be equipped to function productively in the multidisciplinary teams of bioengineers and life scientists prevalent in the industry. California has led the nation in total biotechnology firms, and projected California biotechnology industry annual growth of 5-6% ensures continued demand for qualified personnel. UCLA plays critical roles in support of the local bio-industry as a generator of innovative, commercially viable technology and as the educator and trainer of biomedical researchers. The interface between the life/health sciences and engineering is extraordinarily rich in its diversity; this biotechnology program focuses broadly on molecular and cellular research. Faculty participants in the proposed BTBSE Program all conduct research focused at the molecular and cellular level, and most have established cross-disciplinary collaborations. The faculty research activities cover a broad spectrum of basic biomedical research related to biotechnology including, enzyme biocatalysis, thermostable enzymes, metabolic engineering, DNA microarray technology, nitric oxide metabolism, molecular basis of neurodegenerative disease, biosensors, tissue engineering, anaerobe microbiology, vaults (protein nanocapsules), nanobiotechnotogy, bioinformatics, genomics, proteomics, protein molecular evolution, and incorporation of unnatural amino acids in recombinant proteins. Such an array of research activities conducted by collaborating researchers provides an exciting menu of multidisciplinary research opportunities to trainees. Faculty participants in the proposed training program have had the opportunity to recruit from a pool of >170 eligible PhD students (including 23 underrepresented minority students) this academic year. In sum, UCLA provides the talented multidisciplinary faculty, bright and diverse students, resources for research, courses, and opportunities to interact with industry that are necessary to mount a successful biotechnology training program.      \",\n",

This building will provide high-quality, LEED-certified, interactive laboratory space for the Colorado Initiative in Molecular Biotechnology (CIMB), which includes computer scientists, chemists, physicists, and engineers whose work impacts on the biomedical scientists. The current proposal requests funds to build out space for biochemists and structural biologists in the Biotech Building - space which would otherwise remain shelled. By allowing these biochemical scientists to work in proximity to CIMB scientists, a vibrant multidisciplinary research program would be created. The three areas of scientific focus are non- coding RNAs in biology and medicine, cell signaling, and structural biology. The translation of this basic research into medicine will be aided by the innovative biotechnology focus of the program, which involves local and national experts in the business and scientific aspects of biotech and the entrepreneurship program of the university's Leeds School of Business. Thus, job creation will occur at three distinct levels: laboratory construction and fit-out, an immediate impact given that the design of the building is already well underway; new faculty, support staff, and administrative staff to be hired upon completion of construction; and stimulation of new jobs in the local biotech industry.      \",\n",

BTP trainees are admitted to one of four core academic programs contributing to the BTP (Integrated Program in Biochemistry, Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, or Microbiology) or to another approved doctoral program on the UW campus. Upon selection of a mentor, who must be an approved BTP trainer, BTP trainees fulfill all Ph.D. requirements of their home department. Thus the BTP first integrates the existing academic excellence of our participating Ph.D.-granting units into our comprehensive training plan. This aspect of the BTP program assures that each BTP trainee receives the depth of discipline-specific training needed to become a future leader in his or her respective field. The BTP significantly enhances the educational experience and distinguishes all BTP trainees from their peers by providing requirements specifically designed to promote cross-disciplinary research training. These include 1) a BTP-approved biotechnology-oriented minor degree plan, 2) interactions with a BTP minor professor from another discipline during the entire dissertation period, 3) oral presentations in the BTP-led Biotechnology Seminar program, 4) participation in a BTP-originated Foundations of Cross-Disciplinary Research course, 5) completion of the BTP-led research ethics course, and 6) an industrial internship. These enhanced training experiences ensure that all BTP trainees, regardless of their major Ph.D. program, will be conversant in the principles of molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry, physiology, and quantitative sciences required to function as cross-disciplinary scientists and engineers in the 21st century. In its 19-year history, the BTP has trained 223 Ph.D. students who have worked with 125 different faculty BTP trainers in 25 distinct Ph.D. programs. Our BTP graduates are now emerging as prominent scientists in industry and federal laboratories, and as professors in academia. Other UW students can participate in BTP activities and thus expand the breadth and impact of cross-disciplinary training across campus. Broader participation also increases exposure of BTP trainees to recent technological advances that are being used to solve emerging problems at the biological-physical science interface. The UW-Madison is proud to partner with NIH in continuing to provide vigorous support for training of the 30 NIGMS-funded trainees that comprise the BTP, and who collectively represent a strong promise and hope for sustained national prominence in biomedical research.      \",\n",

BTP students intraining (16) or graduated (2; plus several this summer) entered with an average undergraduate GPA of 3.53, include two minorities,and are currently hosted by seven different departments. One trainee received the top graduate student award in UVa's basicmedical sciences in '03, another was runnerup, and a third was recently nominated for '04. Trainees have published 28 peerreviewed articles, submitted 69 abstracts, experienced nine different company externships, and are planning eight more in the USand overseas. Trainees have taken direct responsibility for programmatic features of the BTP including: editorship of the BTPnewsletter, organization of BTP Minority Day, high school outreach, BTP poster presentations at other institutions, organization ofBTP seminars, social activities, new student dinner, BTP Symposia, and the BTP website. Mentoring our trainees is a highlyengaged, collaborative and well-funded faculty of thirty-seven individualsfrom departments nationally ranked by NIH funding ashigh as #3 (Cell Biology) and #5 (Microbiology). Institutional support has been essential for our success, particularly the importantrole of the Graduate Programs Office in day to day administration of the Program. Also important has been sustained funding ofthree extra slots by the Deans of Engineering and Medicine, and the enthusiastic organization of company tours and externships bythe Health Science Development Office. We view the BTP's mission as threefold: (i) most importantly to train our students to dothe best science possible, (ii) to provide a meaningful experience in industrial science via our externship program, and (iii) topromote scientific synergy among BTP students of different disciplines through regular BTP Journal Clubs/Data Sessions, Seminarsand Symposia. We argue in the following competitive renewal that success in each of these areas has been achieved, therebyhelping to develop a new generation of young scientists who approach new scientific challenges with analytical minds and anextensive array of modern technologies.\",\n",

Thus, the core research aims to create innovations that are developed by 'Biomedical Engineering' into 'Technologies for the Study of Molecular and Cellular Structure and Function.'  It is the challenges of 'impossible'- but crucial - biological problems that motivate each new direction of our core research, leading to developments of instrumentation to facilitate our collaborations and services, the dissemination of the resulting innovations, and to training of participants and clients to support the transfer of the new technologies to the biomedical community.  This combination of instrument development and collaboration is efficient and synergistic, with frequent reciprocal intellectual exchanges between collaborators and staff creating new concepts and understanding for both groups.    The program comprises three classes of projects:  (1) Biomedical instrumentation engineering to advance the effectiveness of biomedical application of the technologies of multiphoton microscopy (MPM) and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), invented and already featured in DRBIO.  (2) New directions of development of photophysical technologies, focusing particularly on robust optical markers for sensitive single molecule observations, and on in vivo imaging of the intrinsic fluorescence of tissue components.  (3) Venturesome biotechnology developments based on new technologies, including optical nanostructures, nonlinear photochemistry and correlation spectroscopy to address several crucial but refractory challenges of biomedical research.  \",\n",

Assess teacher/student proposal related STEM activities and their impact through evaluation tools c. Generate comprehensive reports encompassing all elements of the program Methodology: The proposal offers Environmental Health-Based Biotechnology programs in the Detroit area for secondary education pre- and in-service teachers. Individual lessons will be integrated into existing pre- service methods courses in the College of Education at Wayne State University. In addition, two Summer Institutes are planned as graduate courses for Detroit Public School in-service teachers. Lessons will integrate historical, contemporary and emerging issues in Environmental Health into the following areas: The Genetic Code, Genetic Engineering and Proteins, DNA mutations, Applications of Biotechnology, and Current topics in Biotechnology. Sustainability of the program will be through an equipment loan program and a 'Virtual Learning Community' developed for teachers-by teachers. Evaluation and economic impact: Evaluation regarding the sustainability of the program, teacher content integration, and teacher/student impact will be carried out through follow up survey data collection. It is anticipated that in-service teachers will report having value added to their school, district, and their own job security by integrating the knowledge and techniques supplied through the proposal. It is further anticipated that the pre-service teachers will incorporate skills obtained from the program into their teaching resume to assist with securing a position in a prospective school district. Additionally, there will be a potential cost savings to DPS resulting from retention of participating teachers with the advanced skills and resources derived from inclusion in the proposal's educational programs.     Public Health Relevance: The Environmental Health-Based Biotechnology proposal will offer research-centered professional development to current and future secondary education STEM teachers. This program will promote job creation and sustainability through its ability to increase the understanding of science concepts and skills for teachers and their students in the adversely economically impacted Detroit area.

      "            \"abstract\": \"  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is for funding for graduate students and post-docs to attend the 10th International Symposium on Cytochrome P450 Biodiversity and Biotechnology. This meeting deals with aspects of evolution, structure, function, and application of cytochrome P450 genes and enzymes, emphasizing CYPs in bacteria, fungi, plants, and non-mammalian animal models. The rapidly increasing number of crystal structures coupled with the huge number of CYP sequences (now in excess of 12,000), makes it possible to look at structural evolution from the sequence as well as tertiary structural perspective, with a greater understanding than possible before. Protein structural studies consider function of CYP enzymes in synthesis of bioactive compounds, and in the metabolism of xenobiotic chemicals and endogenous compounds. This meeting also includes engineering of CYP genes, to generate enzymes with novel functions as well as to gain insights into catalytic mechanisms with xenobiotic and endogenous substrates. The application of information and engineered systems in bioremediation, risk assessment and ecological processes is also addressed. The meeting includes responses of each taxonomic group to xenobiotic exposure, and the role of CYP genes and proteins in adaptation and response to that exposure. This will include important non-mammalian animal models used in toxicology, such as zebrafish and others.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application is for funds to provide support for graduate students and post-doctoral students to participate in the 10th International Symposium on Cytochrome P450 Biodiversity and Biotechnology. This meeting will provide a critical forum for discussions on cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes and proteins a wide range of microbial, fungal, insect, plant and some vertebrate species. The overall goal of this 10th symposium is to foster a synthesis of understanding of cytochrome P450 (CYP) structural and functional evolution, and new directions in application this knowledge in environmental assessment, remediation, and synthesis of new potential drugs. The goals will be accomplished by providing a mechanism for garnering new ideas and input from outstanding scientists that represent a very diverse background of expertise and training, at the forefront of research on CYP genes. Sessions in this meeting include evolutionary and mechanistic comparisons among available P450 structures, functional comparisons among microbial, insect and plant P450s in synthetic and detoxification pathways, as well as bioengineering of P450 catalytic sites for technological and environmental applications. Participation of graduate students and post-doctoral students is important for a continued vitality in this important area of research.            \",\n",

Thus, the core research aims to create innovations that are developed by 'Biomedical Engineering' into 'Technologies for the Study of Molecular and Cellular Structure and Function.'  It is the challenges of 'impossible'- but crucial - biological problems that motivate each new direction of our core research, leading to developments of instrumentation to facilitate our collaborations and services, the dissemination of the resulting innovations, and to training of participants and clients to support the transfer of the new technologies to the biomedical community.  This combination of instrument development and collaboration is efficient and synergistic, with frequent reciprocal intellectual exchanges between collaborators and staff creating new concepts and understanding for both groups.    The program comprises three classes of projects:  (1) Biomedical instrumentation engineering to advance the effectiveness of biomedical application of the technologies of multiphoton microscopy (MPM) and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), invented and already featured in DRBIO.  (2) New directions of development of photophysical technologies, focusing particularly on robust optical markers for sensitive single molecule observations, and on in vivo imaging of the intrinsic fluorescence of tissue components.  (3) Venturesome biotechnology developments based on new technologies, including optical nanostructures, nonlinear photochemistry and correlation spectroscopy to address several crucial but refractory challenges of biomedical research.  \",\n",

      "            \"abstract\": \"  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is requesting funds to support 'Advances in Optics for Biotechnology, Medicine and Surgery', a small, interdisciplinary conference focused on the field of biomedical optics. Biomedical optics refers to the use of light in medicine and biomedical research, and exploits the many interactions that can occur between tissue and light from ultra-violet to infra-red wavelengths. The broad range of techniques encompassed by this young field are having profound impacts on medical diagnostics and therapy, as well as in biomedical research.  By harnessing the absorption properties of oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin in blood, optical imaging can be used to evaluate tissue function and perfusion. Absorption of light by water is the basis of laser surgery. Intrinsic fluorophores include a range of metabolites and can be exploited to delineate malignant lesions in- vivo. A wide range of optical contrast agents are increasingly being developed, and are complemented by new transgenic techniques that can specifically instruct individual cell types to generate fluorescence contrast. Development of optical imaging techniques that can allow visualization or exploitation of these many contrast mechanisms over length-scales from the whole head or breast, to single cells or sub-cellular components encompasses a wide range of disciplines including physics, engineering, mathematics and computing. This highly interdisciplinary field therefore requires broad skills sets that combine these technical areas with a deep understanding of medical, biomedical and biochemical targets and applications.  This meeting will draw together experts from all facets of biomedical optics research, including clinicians and experts from industry. The conference format is designed to stimulate the sharing of creative ideas across broad areas of medicine and engineering, while providing ample opportunities for students and trainees to diversify their knowledge and develop relationships with key leaders in the field. The conference will be held from the 5-8th June 2011 at Naples Beach Hotel, Naples, Florida, USA and sessions will be composed of invited talks from accomplished senior or rising experts. A poster session will provide students and post- doctoral fellows with ample opportunities to describe and discuss their work. Funds provided by the NIH will be used to defray registration and travel costs for students and invited speakers.  The aims of this meeting are therefore: Aim 1: To identify the newest and most cutting edge developments in the field of biomedical optics, and provide a forum for sharing these new discoveries and ideas. Aim 2: To incorporate topics of fundamental importance to the field to facilitate interdisciplinary learning and training, and to ascertain the progress of promising modalities towards wider adoption / commercialization. Aim 3: To ensure diversity in both speakers and attendees, ensuring that all who have the capacity to contribute to, and gain from the meeting are afforded the opportunity to attend and showcase their work. Aim 4: To create an environment that stimulates networking, exchange of ideas, collaboration, and cross-disciplinary learning.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative 'Advances in Optics for Biotechnology, Medicine and Surgery' is a small (~120 attendee), interdisciplinary conference focused on the field of biomedical optics, which encompasses the use of light for a wide range of imaging, diagnostic and therapeutic applications in medicine and biomedical science. This conference will bring together established experts in all areas of this field, along with students, clinicians and representatives from industry. The meeting will focus on novel and emerging technologies as well as fundamental concepts, and will encourage networking and idea exchange between its diverse participants.      \",\n",

Attaining these goals will ensure economic vitality and growth for the nation as a whole and for the State of Michigan in particular through this proposal. The Environmental Health-Based Biotechnology proposal incorporates research-centered environmental health science topics into biotechnology experiences for secondary education teachers. Wayne State University (located in the adversely economically impacted city of Detroit) will provide these professional development opportunities. Investigators: All Investigators on this proposal, Drs. Dereski (Assoc. Prof.), Grueber (Assist. Prof.) and Alozie (Post Doctoral Fellow) are experienced in science teacher education. Drs. Dereski and Alozie have expertise in Environmental/ Environmental Health as well as biotechnology teaching. Dr. Grueber has a particular research interest in teaching and learning in urban classrooms. Nadine Tibbs-Stallworth (Consultant) is the supervisor of high school science for Detroit Public Schools and will be instrumental in teacher recruitment, support and sustainability of the program beyond the granting period. Innovation: This proposal will contribute to the skills of the participating teachers by integrating technology (teacher-developed Internet accessible materials) and current science laboratory skills (biotechnology). Obtaining this knowledge and skill set, will contribute to the teachers' future and continued viability in the local job market. There is also a potential to stimulate and reinforce teacher/student interest in STEM subjects through the utilization of environmental health-based science as an integrative context for learning. Support for all teachers beyond the proposal timeline will occur through a 'Virtual Learning Community' developed for teachers-by teachers. Aims of the proposal: Specific Aim 1: Contribute to the development and competency of pre-service STEM teachers through integration of Environmental Health-Based Biotechnology lessons into an existing methods course. Specific Aim 2: Integrate environmental health science research and technology into a STEM-based Summer Institute for Detroit Public School in-service teachers. Specific Aim 3: Provide Sustainability, Assessment and Reporting for the Program a. Provide Teacher Support and Sustainability through a Virtual Learning Community b. Assess teacher/student proposal related STEM activities and their impact through evaluation tools c. Generate comprehensive reports encompassing all elements of the program Methodology: The proposal offers Environmental Health-Based Biotechnology programs in the Detroit area for secondary education pre- and in-service teachers. Individual lessons will be integrated into existing pre- service methods courses in the College of Education at Wayne State University. In addition, two Summer Institutes are planned as graduate courses for Detroit Public School in-service teachers. Lessons will integrate historical, contemporary and emerging issues in Environmental Health into the following areas: The Genetic Code, Genetic Engineering and Proteins, DNA mutations, Applications of Biotechnology, and Current topics in Biotechnology. Sustainability of the program will be through an equipment loan program and a 'Virtual Learning Community' developed for teachers-by teachers. Evaluation and economic impact: Evaluation regarding the sustainability of the program, teacher content integration, and teacher/student impact will be carried out through follow up survey data collection. It is anticipated that in-service teachers will report having value added to their school, district, and their own job security by integrating the knowledge and techniques supplied through the proposal. It is further anticipated that the pre-service teachers will incorporate skills obtained from the program into their teaching resume to assist with securing a position in a prospective school district. Additionally, there will be a potential cost savings to DPS resulting from retention of participating teachers with the advanced skills and resources derived from inclusion in the proposal's educational programs.\",\n",
